Also, and quite appropriately, the link to 404 is 404 (as is the link to
404-compliant) - both in the change log and in the glossary itself.  The
links say "http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/0/404.html" and
"http://.../404-compliant.html", respectively; but going through the
root (http://.../0.html) the entries are found under
"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/0/code-404.html" and
"http://.../code-404-compliant.html", respectively.  (Apologies if my
method of URL abbreviation is non-standard.)
