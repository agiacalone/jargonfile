			MARKUP EXTENSIONS

The DocBook Glossary element doesn't have as much structure as we want.
So it gets abused in these ways:

1. The Abbrev sub-part is used for part-of-speech and pronunciation
   info.

In entries with multiple senses:

2. In GlossDef, the attribute role='etymology' is used for a historical
   or etymological note that is not part of the definition and should
   run *before* the definition body.  

3. In GlossDef, the attribute role='history' is used for a historical
   or etymological note that is not part of the definition  and should
   run *after* the definition body.

4. In GlossDef, the attribute role='references' is used for a
   collection of See and See Also references not connected 
   with a particular definition  and should
   run *after* the definition body.

Other extensions:

5. A SystemItem tag with the role attribute 'newsgroup' is used to tag
   newsgroup names.

			SPECIAL FONTS

The first example under `blinkenlights', and its header, should be set
in Fraktur.  To do this, the XML stylsheet has to do the right thing 
with remap="fraktur" in an Emphasis tag.

			ATTRIBUTIONS

Most of these entries are attributed with name of poster and date
(this is implicitly a pointer back to the old-entries archive).  Special
codes are as follows:

	ESR          - written by Eric S. Raymond during TNHD revision
	GLS          - written by Guy Steele during TNHD revision
	MRC          - written by Mark Crispin during TNHD revision
	TMRC         - incorporated from the TMRC Dictionary
		       or personal communication with Peter Samson.
	IBM          - from Per Lindberg's IBM jargon file
	MSB          - by Mark Brader
	XEROX        - derived from the XEROX PARC glossary
                       forwarded by Marc Weiser, Feb 14 1992.

Entries marked with SOURCE UNKNOWN are the ones for which I have
been unable to recover a source.  These were collected early in the
project, before my record-keeping became really meticulous.

Entries marked with BACKPOINTER have multiple senses, with
cross-references elsewhere that point at a specific sense.  Be
careful to change the xrefs if you add or reorder senses.

Entries marked with SANITY-DATE contain perishable material, that
is, datable assertions about present time.

Unfortunately, only the dates are really reliable as keys back into
the submission-mail files.  In a few cases of people changing sites
and/or the form of their name-among-humans that they use I've had to
do some patching so there wouldn't be duplicate names showing up in
the credits list.  Someday I ought to replace these pointers with
Message-IDs.
	
		REVISION HISTORIES

The change histories in the masters include almost complete data for
File versions back to 1981.

1.1.0 is the oldest version I have been able to locate, recovered from
a 1981 user group tape.

1.2.0 is from 14 November 1982. 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 are trivial variants
of this file, which seems to be the "final" version most archives have
a copy of.  When people refer to the "original" Jargon File, this is 
what they mean.

1.5.0 is Guy Steele's 1983 book version, the original Hacker's Dictionary.

Revision-history entries add/changed/delete entries are complete back
to 2.9.7, when I started keeping change logs mechanically.  Change
data is also complete for 2,6.1->2.6.2->2.6.3 and 2.8.2->2.8.3

Additions and deletions (but not necessarily changes) are complete back 
to 1.1.0; I reconstructed this information by making wordlists from 
the pre-2.9.7 versions, and generated RevHistory entries from comm(1) 
listings.  

Note, however that releases 2.9.[1-5] are missing.  I don't think any
of those were public.

<preface id='gls-preface'><title>Confessions of a Happy Hacker</title>
<!-- authorblurb Guy L. Steele -->

<para>I was a teen-age hacker.</para>

<para>When I was about twelve or so, a lab secretary at MIT who knew I was
&lsquo;interested in science&rsquo; (it might be more accurate to say &rsquo;a
latent nerd&lsquo; &mdash; more on that later) arranged for one of the
computer hackers there to give me an informal tour.  I remember stumbling
around racks full of circuit boards and wires, a screeching cabinet that
printed a full page every six seconds, and rows of blinking lights; the
computer room was crammed full of equipment with no obvious organization.  One
set of gray cabinets had some trophies and plaques sitting on it: this was the
PDP-6 computer that, running a program called MacHack, won prizes playing
against human players in chess tournaments.  The PDP-6 also had two speakers
and a stereo amplifier sitting on top of it.  The hacker typed a couple of
commands on a keyboard, and the PDP-6 burst into a Bach Brandenburg concerto
(no. 6, as I recall).</para>

<para>One part of that tour stands out most clearly in my mind.  I was told to
sit down in front of a large, round, glass screen and was given a box that had
some buttons and a stick on the top.  My hacker guide typed another command on
the keyboard and, suddenly, green and purple spaceships appeared on the
screen!  The purple one started shooting little red dots at the green one,
which was soon obliterated in a multicolored shower of sparkles.  The green
ship was mine, and the hacker had expertly shot it down.  Years later I
learned that this had been a color version of Space War, one of the very first
video games.</para>

<para>Remember that this was years before &lsquo;Apple&rsquo; and
&lsquo;TRS-80&rsquo; had become household words.  Back then computers were
still rather mysterious, hidden away in giant corporations and university
laboratories.</para>

<para>Playing Space War was fun, but I learned nothing of programming then.  I
had the true fascination of computers revealed to me in November, 1968, when a
chum slipped me the news that our school (Boston Latin) had an IBM computer
locked up in the basement.  I was dubious.  I had earlier narrowly avoided
buying from a senior a ticket to the fourth-floor swimming pool (Boston Latin
has only three stories, and no swimming pool at all), and assumed this was
another scam.  So of course I laughed in his face.</para>

<para>When he persisted, I checked it out.  Sure enough, in a locked basement
room was an IBM 1130 computer.  If you want all the specs: 4096 words of
memory, 16 bits per word, a 15-character-per-second Selectric (&lsquo;golf
ball&rsquo;) printer, and a card reader (model 1442) that could read 300 cards
per minute.  Yes, this was back in the days of punched cards.  Personal
computers were completely unheard of then.</para>

<para>Nominally the computer was for the training of juniors and seniors, but
I cajoled a math teacher into lending me a computer manual and spent all of
Thanksgiving vacation reading it.</para>

<para>I was hooked.</para>

<para>No doubt about it.  I was born to be a hacker.  Fortunately, I didn't
let my studies suffer (as many young hackers do), but every spare moment I
thought about the computer.  It was spellbinding.  I wanted to know all about
it: what it could and couldn't do, how its programs worked, what its circuits
looked like.  During study halls, lunch, and after school, I could be found in
the computer room, punching programs onto cards and running them through the
computer.</para>

<para>I was not the only one.  Very soon there was a small community of IBM
1130 hackers.  We helped to maintain the computer and we tutored our less
fanatical fellow students in the ways of computing.  What could possibly
compensate us for these chores?  Free rein in the computer room.</para>

<para>Soon after that, I developed into one of the unauthorized but tolerated
&lsquo;random people&rsquo; hanging around the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory.  A random hacker is to a computer laboratory much as a groupie is
to a rock band: not really doing useful work, but emotionally involved and
contributing to the ambience, if nothing else.  After a while, I was haunting
the computer rooms at off-hours, talking to people but more often looking for
chances to run programs.  Sometimes &lsquo;randoms&rsquo; such as I were quite
helpful, operating the computers for no pay and giving advice to college
students who were having trouble.  Sometimes, however, we were quite a
nuisance.  Once I was ejected from the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by
none other than Richard Greenblatt, the very famous hacker who had written the
MacHack program with which the PDP-6 had won its chess trophies.  He threw me
out because I was monopolizing the one terminal that produced letter-quality
copy.  (I was using the computer as a word processor to write customized form
letters to various computer manufacturers, asking them to send me computer
manuals.)  I deserved to be tossed out and gave him no argument.  But when
you're hooked, you're hooked, and I was undaunted; within a week or two I was
back again.</para>

<para>Eventually I got a part-time job as a programmer at MIT's Project MAC
computer laboratory.  There I became a full-fledged member of the hacker
community, and ultimately an MIT graduate student.</para>

<para>I was never a lone hacker, but one of many.  Despite stories you may
have read about anti-social nerds glued permanently to display screens,
totally addicted to the computer, hackers have (human) friends too.  Through
timesharing (where many people use one computer) and networking (where many
computers are connected together), the computer makes possible a new form of
human communication, better than the telephone and the postal system put
together.  You can send a message by electronic mail and get a reply within
two minutes, or you can just link two terminals together and have a
conversation.  This sort of thing used to be a near-exclusive province of
hackers, but is nowadays quite commonplace through commercial services such as
Compuserve and GEnie.</para>

<para>Speaking of nerds: a hacker doesn't have to be a nerd (but it helps).
More important, it is certainly not true that all nerds are hackers!  Too many
nerds are just nerds.  But I must mention one more story from my days at MIT.
When the famous National Lampoon <quote>Are You a Nerd?</quote>  poster first came out in
the mid-1970s, a secretary at MIT bought a copy to post outside her office
door so everyone at the laboratory could enjoy the joke (which we did,
immensely).  As she was taping it up, I happened to be leaving for dinner,
briefcase in hand.  I glanced at the poster, then put on my glasses (heavy
black frames &mdash; I still wear them), hiked up my polyester slacks an extra
half-inch, and assumed The Pose (booger and all).  I matched about 80% of the
itemized points: button-down shirt with loose collar, six pens in my shirt
pocket, same haircut &mdash; too bad I had left my slide rule at home.  The
poor secretary turned beet-red and protested, <quote>N-no!  I didn't mean
<emphasis>you</emphasis>!</quote>  I just chuckled and told her that the poster
artist had obviously done a remarkably good job.  (Being a nerd isn't all bad
&mdash; sometimes it can turn a girl's head.  Once, when I was fifteen, I was
strolling across Copley Square in downtown Boston and passed three bubblegum
teenyboppers.  I just barely caught one of them exclaiming to her friends,
<quote>Wow!  Did you see all those pens?</quote>)</para>

<para>Perhaps one reason for the nerd-hacker connection is that the truly
dedicated hacker does little else but eat, sleep, and hack.  Hackers often
work strange hours that put them out of synch with normal humanity.  Some
hackers just get up at dinnertime and go to bed after breakfast, or perhaps
get up at noon and sack out at 4 AM.  (See the terms
<glossterm>phase</glossterm> and <glossterm>night mode</glossterm> for more
information on hackers' sleeping schedules.)  Before computers were
inexpensive enough to be &lsquo;personal&rsquo;, they had to be shared, either
by taking turns or by what is called timesharing (where the computer is
programmed to take turns at split-second speeds).  Either way, there was
heavier demand for the computer during the day than at night, because
non-hacker users tended to work during the day.  Hackers often therefore
worked late into the evening or night, when the other computer users weren't
competing for cycles.  It's more fun, after all, to use the computer when it's
responding at split-second speeds.</para>

<para>Now that personal computers and individual workstations are ubiquitous,
there is less need to avoid day shifts.  Many hackers, however, still find a
10PM-to-6AM or noon-to-8AM schedule more pleasant than rising at the crack of
dawn.  There are different theories about why this is so: my personal one is
that there is some correlation between the hackish sort of creativity and
&lsquo;night person&rsquo; physiology.  It has also been suggested that
working at night is an adaptation to the hacker's need for long stretches of
<glossterm>hack mode</glossterm>, a literally altered state of consciousness
that doesn't tolerate distractions well; I find this eminently reasonable.
Just as the VCR has allowed television watchers to &lsquo;time-shift&rsquo;
movies, electronic mail allows the hacker to time-shift most of his
communication with others, making it much less important for everyone to have
exactly the same work hours.</para>

<para>The earliest of the hacker cultures that directly contributed to this
book was the one that grew up around the PDP-1 at MIT in the early 1960s (many
of these people were also in TMRC, the Tech Model Railroad Club).  Later, the
PDP-1 hackers formed the nucleus of the famed MIT AI Lab.  Thus, when I began
hacking there I connected with a tradition that was already well established,
and was to continue as one of its most important sub-communities for another
decade.</para>

<para>But MIT had no monopoly on hackers.  In the 1960s and 1970s hackers
congregated around any computer center that made computer time available for
play.  (Some of this play turned out to be very important work, but hacking is
done mostly for fun, for its own sake, for the pure joy of it.)  Because
universities tend to be more flexible than corporations in this regard, most
hackers' dens arose in university laboratories.  While some of these hackers
were unauthorized &lsquo;random people&rsquo; like me, many hackers were paid
employees who chose to stay after hours and work on their own projects &mdash;
or even continue their usual work &mdash; purely for pleasure.</para>

<para>The hacker community became larger and more closely knit after 1969,
when the government funded a project to see whether it would be useful and
practical to let the computers at dozens of universities and other sites
&lsquo;talk&rsquo; to each other.  The project succeeded and produced the
famous ARPANET, a network that now links hundreds of computers across the
country.  Through the ARPANET researchers could share programs, trade research
results, and send electronic mail &mdash; both to individuals and to massive
mailing lists.  And it first allowed once-isolated hackers to talk to each
other via computer.  During the two decades that followed, other networks grew
and connected to the ARPANET.  Eventually software gave most of these a common
address space; the resulting super-network, called &lsquo;Internet&rsquo; or
simply &lsquo;the net&rsquo;, links thousands and thousands of computers
worldwide.  The ARPANET itself no longer exists as a distinct entity.</para>

<para>The result is a worldwide hackers' community, now two decades old.  In
some ways the community serves as a geographically dispersed think tank;
people use it to share ideas and software.  One good recent example of this
was during the great cold-fusion flap of 1988; many of the papers on both
sides of the dispute were available on the net long before making
print.</para>

<para>But the net also has a social importance non-hackers tend to miss.  I
have many friends that I have never met face to face or talked to on the
telephone.  I feel I know them quite well, though, because I've had extended
conversations with them through the computer.  (I had one friend through the
computer who worked in the same building that I did, but I never knew he was
deaf until I chanced to meet him face to face several months later!)</para>

<para>When you walk up to the terminal of a time-shared computer, the first
thing you do is to &lsquo;log in&rsquo;, that is, tell the computer who you
are.  As a result everyone acquires a login name, which you need to know to
communicate with another hacker via computer.  A login name serves in much the
same way as a CB &lsquo;handle&rsqyuo;.  Login names are often used as
nicknames, pronounced if possible and spelled if necessary.  My wife and I met
at MIT, and she still calls me <quote>Gliss</quote> because my login name was
GLS <quote>Guy</quote> still sounds very weird to her, even after N years of
marriage.</para>

<para>On the net, people are usually known by their logins and addresses.
Thus, I have many friends whom I know only by login name; I have no idea what
their real names are.  Once, at a wedding, I ran into a good hacker friend who
was also a guest there.  I recalled his login name instantly, but was
embarrassed that I couldn't immediately remember his real name in order to
introduce him to a third person.  It was &lsquo;swapped out&rsquo; (see
<glossterm>swap</glossterm>).  A more egregious example: when Barbara and I
got married, we sent out wedding invitations of the usual sort without
considering the consequences.  One hacker friend was completely puzzled:
<quote>Barbara Kerns &ellipsis; Guy Steele &ellipsis; Who
<emphasis>are</emphasis> these people???</quote> His girlfriend looked over
his shoulder and said, tentatively, <quote>Guy Steele &ellipsis; isn't that
Quux?</quote> This was someone I knew quite well, but he knew me only by that
handle.  Some hackers actually prefer to be called by their login name and
seldom use their given (&lsquo;mundane&rsquo;) names (Richard Stallman, aka
RMS, is a well-known example).</para>

<para>In these and other ways, the working and social life of the hacker
revolves primarily around the computer.  This is not to say that hackers have
no other interests; for a look at those, see Appendix B, <link
linkend="appendixb">A Portrait of J. Random Hacker</link>.  But hackerdom is
defined by the community of interest that has grown up around computers and
electronic networks.  Indeed, these electronic networks have grown in
importance over time.</para>

<para>When I drafted the first version of this preface, in 1983, I expressed
some concern that hackerdom might be dying &mdash; killed off, ironically, by
the spread of knowledge about computers.  As programming education became more
formalized, as the personal computer atomized hacker communities previously
knitted together by timesharing, and as the lure of big money in industry
siphoned off some of the best and brightest, it seemed as though hackerdom's
unique values might be lost.</para>

<para>Though these gloomy predictions were an accurate projection of some
trends of that year, they didn't survive an editor's objections and never made
it into the first edition.  This is perhaps fortunate; now, in 1991, I am
happy to report that hacking is most certainly not dead.  Some of its
traditional vehicles, licit and illicit, have disappeared: the PDP-10 is no
longer manufactured, and improved technology and security have made phone
phreaking much less intellectually rewarding.  But the hacking spirit remains
very much alive.  The personal computer revolution has made hackers free to
hack almost anywhere &mdash; and the net is the community glue.</para>

<para>This book was put together almost entirely through the net.  Hundreds of
contributors responded to a net-wide request for new entries and updates.
Eric Raymond sifted through thousands of electronic messages, collecting old
and new words and cross-checking the evidence.  (By the way, I got to know
Eric through the net &mdash; we worked on this project for about a year before
meeting face to face.)</para>

<para><citetitle>The New Hacker's Dictionary</citetitle> reflects the
technological and social changes in the hacker community over the last decade
or so (Eric's preface discusses some of these).  At times, assisting Eric in
this project has made me feel like an old fuddy-duddy; more often I have felt
freshly charged with the excitement of the hacker spirit.  Hackers are doing
exciting new things and coining new words and phrases to describe their
changing and innovative culture.  If you want to get involved, interest,
ability, and computer access are pretty much the only requirements; social
skills help a great deal but are not mandatory.  If you are just curious, this
book provides a window into a strange world that may amuse or astonish you.
Whichever it may be, welcome!</para>

<preface id='esr-preface'><title>Hacker in a Strange Land</title>
<!-- Eric S. Raymond -->

<para>I am a hacker of a later generation than Guy Steele and the coauthors of
the first edition, and my history is different from theirs in a way that
illuminates the major changes that have taken place in hackerdom since that
edition was published in 1983.  This revised and massively expanded edition is
a response to those changes, so I think a bit of my history might illuminate
its whys and wherefores.</para>

<para>Back around 1968, I was one of the first few hundred people in the world
to play a video game.  I was about twelve years old, and my father (an
executive for UNIVAC and himself formerly one of the very first programmers
back in the days of the great electromechanical dinosaurs of the 1950s) sat me
down in front of an $8 million mainframe and showed me how.  The program was a
demo for the UNISCOPE 3000, which many have called the first commercial video
terminal.  By pressing keys on the keyboard, you could drop a bomb from a
little vector-graphic bomber at a stick-figure freighter sailing serenely
across the cartoon sea at the bottom of the tube.  If you hit (which wasn't
trivial, because the bomb followed a proper parabolic trajectory) the machine
would oblige with a lovely little explosion, after which the ship would break
up and sink majestically beneath the waves.</para>

<para>I was fascinated &mdash; even more so after they showed me the keys that
allowed one to vary the speed of the bomber, the speed of the ship, and the
height and angle of the bomber's passes.  I quickly mastered hitting the ship
and lost interest in the default settings; I spent the rest of my time there
experimenting with various extreme combinations of the simulation parameters
&mdash; hacking at the program, trying to see what I could make it do.  I
remember being disappointed at the realization that the ship would break up in
exactly the same way regardless of where the bomb hit.</para>

<para>It took me ten years to realize it, but that experience set my feet on
the road to hackerdom.  In 1972, I played BASIC games on some
<emphasis>amazingly</emphasis> clunky ASR-33 teletypes hooked up to the old
Dartmouth Time-Sharing System; I'll never forget the uniquely satisfying
<emphasis>tchoonk</emphasis> those stiff keys made, and the musty smell and
feel of the yellow paper they spooled on the carriage in huge rolls.  I hadn't
learned how to program yet, but DTSS included some rudimentary email/talk mode
facilities and I had my first exposure to the odd and wonderful world of
on-line communication there.  Then, in high school around 1974, I did a little
hacking on a Wang 720B &lsquo;programmable calculator&rsquo;, a big clunky
machine with a neat nixie-tube display that you could program with ditsy
little punched cards; five years later it would have been called a personal
computer. But what I was serious about was wanting to be a pure mathematician;
all this stuff with computers was just playing around.</para>

<para>If I'd gone to MIT, I would certainly have gravitated to the AI Lab
hacker culture, which was perhaps at its most vigorous when I started college
in 1976.  As things turned out, I went to the University of Pennsylvania and
learned hacking more or less on my own using a borrowed account on the
Wharton School's DEC-10.  When it became apparent that I'd taken on too much
too soon and burned out in the math department, getting seriously into hacking
seemed the most natural thing in the world.  In 1978, I was mousing around on
the ITS systems using a tourist account over the ARPANET; by 1979, I was
handholding for APL and LISP users, making my lunch money coding for research
projects, and writing a manual for UCI LISP that for all I know may still be
in use at Penn.  And sometime in there I got my first look at the old Jargon
File.  I loved it, and I spread some of the jargon around among the other
expert-user and fledgling-hacker types at my site.</para>

<para>My first real job, in 1980, was in a LISP support group for AI research
at Burroughs.  But that only lasted a year, and it was after that that my
career really took a turn away from what, up to then, had been the classical
hacker growth path.  I'd been one of the last generation of LISP hackers to
cut my teeth on the PDP-10; and, while I was at Burroughs, I became one of the
first to get involved with microcomputers.  I bought an Osborne 1 and learned
CP/M; a few months later, I ditched that and bought IBM PC number
six-hundred-and-something.</para>

<para>Yes, the age of the personal computer had arrived.  For the next two and
a half years I toiled over TRS-80s and IBM PCs in a basement sweatshop off
Walnut Street in Philadelphia.  In 1983 I went to work for a startup company
in the suburbs, helping write comm software to link microcomputers to VAXen
and IBM mainframes.  Outside, change was overtaking the AI-hacker culture that
Steele &amp; Co. had grown up in and I had briefly been part of.  The DEC-10
died, displaced by the <glossterm>VAX</glossterm>; the AI Lab lost its bloom as rival groups tried to
commercialize LISP and AI technology; and, almost unnoticed by the AI crowd,
an operating system called UNIX was beginning to win hearts and minds out in
the real world.</para>

<para>I'd first become intrigued by UNIX in 1974 after reading the classic
Thompson and Ritchie paper in <citetitle>Communications of the
ACM</citetitle>, only to have my curiosity pooh-poohed by my father's
mainframe colleagues.  When I moved to the 'burbs in '83 I learned C and sold
my new employers on the idea of training me into their house UNIX wizard
&mdash; and that's just what I did for two and a half years.  I grew into my
maturity as a programmer right along with UNIX and C, watching them spread
from a few niches in academic and research environments into an unstoppable
tide that completely transformed the computing landscape.</para>

<para>The second time I saw the Jargon File was in late '83, right around the
time the first edition of <citetitle>The Hacker's Dictionary</citetitle> came
out &mdash; with nary a word about C or microcomputers or UNIX or any of the
areas where I <emphasis>knew</emphasis> the hottest action in computers was
happening.  At the time I just accepted it &mdash; in fact, I printed out a
copy and gave it to my boss as a joke, in a report folder blazoned with
<quote>UNDERSTANDING YOUR HACKER</quote> in big letters on the outside.  And then I
hardly thought about it for the next six years.  I was very busy programming,
writing, consulting, and building a professional reputation as a UNIX expert.
I was lucky; my background convinced me earlier than most that UNIX on
microcomputers was going to be the wave of the commodity-computing future, so
I was out front ready to catch it as it rose.</para>

<para>When I stumbled across the Jargon File again in early 1990, then, I saw
it from a new and more confident point of view.  By then, I'd known Richard
Stallman for years and had brought EMACS into the UNIX shops I'd been working
in.  I'd grown used to seeing my own history and skills as a bridge between
the old LISP/PDP-10/ARPANET culture and the huge newer community of C and
UNIX hackers and Usenetters and personal computer hobbyists in which I'd spent
most of the 1980s.  I'd even originated some jargon terms myself that I'd seen
pass into fairly wide use on Usenet or elsewhere (See: 
<glossterm>bondage-and-discipline language</glossterm>, 
<!-- glossterm>code-grinder</glossterm -->,
<glossterm>crawling horror</glossterm>, <glossterm>defenestration</glossterm>,
<glossterm>drool-proof paper</glossterm>, 
<glossterm>fear and loathing</glossterm>, <glossterm>larval stage</glossterm>, 
<glossterm>nailed to the wall</glossterm>, <glossterm>quantum bogodynamics</glossterm>,
<glossterm>raster burn</glossterm>, <!-- glossterm>rice box</glossterm -->,
<glossterm>silly walk</glossterm>).</para>

<para>So I called Guy Steele one day, and we hit it off well and got to
talking &ellipsis; and the result is this <citetitle>New Hacker's
Dictionary</citetitle> you hold in your hands.  It's more than just a meeting
of two cultures, his and mine, because we decided to make an effort to get
input from all the different technical cultures we could reach.</para>

<para>So although a bit over half the entries are from the C/UNIX world and
many of the rest are from the ITS/LISP culture of the old Jargon file, there
are healthy contributions from supercomputing, graphics, the compiler-design
community, TCP/IP wizards, microcomputer developers, and just about everywhere
else in computing where the true hacker nature is manifested.</para>

<para>A few days after I wrote the first version of this preface (in late
April 1990), I received network mail indicating that the ITS machines were
going to be shut down in the near future.  These were the home of the old
Jargon File and the digital heartland of the old AI-hacker culture at MIT;
despite a couple of remnant ITS sites in Sweden, the decision to retire them
truly marked the end of an era.  They will doubtless be replaced by some
conglomeration of UNIX machines &mdash; the final sign that it's truly up to
the UNIX and C community to keep the flame alive now.</para>

<para>We hope this expanded lexicon will be educational to fledgling hackers,
thought-provoking to linguists and anthropologists, and interesting to future
historians of our technological age.  And we hope it helps preserve and extend
the values of the hacker culture: the dedication, the irreverence, the respect
for competence, and the intellectual playfulness that makes hackers such a
stimulating group to be among.  But most of all, we hope it will be
fun.</para>
</preface>

<preface  id='esr-preface2'><title>Preface to the Second Edition</title>

<para>Hackerdom's support of and the general public's response to the first
edition of this book vastly exceeded our expectations.  We are delighted to be
able to bring you this revised and updated second edition.</para>

<para>The more than 250 new entries represent a quite substantial amount of
fresh material.  We are even more pleased to be able to include many
historical and etymological additions to existing entries, many of which
adduce vital facts previously unrecorded in print.</para>

<para>Special thanks to Pete Samson <email>prs@fernwood.mpk.ca.us</email>,
compiler of the first TMRC Dictionary in 1959, for resurfacing to clarify the
murky origins of several important jargon terms.  In a few cases Mr. Samson's
revelations overturned folk etymologies of long standing in hackerdom.</para>

<para>One of the goals for TNHD was to assist mainstream lexicographers and
linguists in better understanding the meaning and etymology of some hackerisms
which have passed into general use.  We've since realized that the size and
breadth of the collection might actually make it an embarrassment of riches
for that audience.  Accordingly, we direct the mainstream lexicographer's

<preface  id='esr-preface3'><title>Preface to the Third Edition</title>
<!-- Eric S. Raymond  -->

<para>It's five years after the first publication of TNHD, and the Internet
seems to be taking over the world.  The immense popularity of the World Wide
Web has created an exploding demand for Internet services and guides to the
Internet's peculiar culture, and Web or Internet-mail addresses now routinely
appear on TV and in major print media.  The startling success of Linux has
made cheap UNIX systems accessible as never before, and the promise of
technologies like Java and VRML beckons hackers all over the world to feats of
inventiveness that will undoubtedly stand comparison to any in its
history. </para>

<para>Curiously, Linux and mass access to the Internet haven't given rise to
the huge efflorescence of entirely new jargon one might expect; instead, many
existing jargon terms have acquired new spins and become more widely known
outside of hackerdom proper.  Perhaps this reflects the fact that, startling
though their impact on the general public is, the new technologies have so far
mostly changed relative costs and scales of activity rather than opening up
domains of possibility fundamentally new to the imaginations of hard-core
hackers. </para>

<para>Accordingly, this third edition of TNHD mainly deepens rather than
broadens the lexicon; there are about a hundred new entries, but many more
changes adding new meanings, background, and etymological history.  One very
notable such addition is divided between the entries for
<glossterm>kluge</glossterm> and <glossterm>kludge</glossterm> and may settle
in a rather startling way the longstanding culture wars over the spelling of
these words.</para>

<para>The culture of hackerdom continues to be a fascinating scene to observe
and be part of.  One of the most interesting things to watch is how it is
responding to the massive wave of popular interest in the Internet, and how
popular culture itself is beginning to be subtly reshaped by the technology of
the Internet <emphasis>and</emphasis> the culture of the hackers who maintain
it.  In the age of the <quote>information superhighway</quote> TNHD is more relevant, and
more needed, than ever before.  The next five years should be very
interesting.</para>
</preface>

<preface id='esr-preface4'><title>Preface to the Fourth Edition</title>
<!-- Eric S. Raymond -->

<para>In the five years since the last edition, the hacker culture this
dictionary describes has gone through some tremendous and largely positive
changes.  Linux's breakthrough into the commercial mainstream following the
Mozilla release of early 1998 synergized with the continuing explosion of the
Internet to change many peoples' assumptions about us.  Hacker culture isn't
just for hackers any more!</para>

<para>Previous editions of this book, as it turns out, played a subtle but not
unimportant role in this change.  Your humble editor's experience with TNHD
helped develop the visibility and communications skills that he needed to take
a very public role in the mainstreaming of &lsquo;open source&rsquo; and the
hacker culture.  More directly, TNHD's admirers turned out to include a lot of
journalists and writers who were ready to hear the open-source story &mdash;
and ready to help tell it &mdash; because they liked what they had read
here. </para>

<para>The maturation of web search engines and tools like Google has put
powerful new tools in lexicographers' hands.  We can now rapidly check for
live usage on the Web and Usenet.  This has enabled us to flush a significant
number of dead terms and ringers (never-caught-on personal inventions that got
by our filters).  This fourth edition, we believe, does a better job of
tracking actual live usage than any of its predecessors.</para>

in the Third Edition preface:</para>

<chapter id="introduction"><title>Hacker Slang and Hacker Culture</title>

<para>This document is a collection of slang terms used by various subcultures
of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is included for
background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we describe here
is the language hackers use among themselves for fun, social communication,
and technical debate.  </para>

<para>The &lsquo;hacker culture&rsquo; is actually a loosely networked
collection of subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important
shared experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because hackers
as a group are particularly creative people who define themselves partly by
rejection of &lsquo;normal&rsquo; values and working habits, it has unusually
rich and conscious traditions for an intentional culture less than 50 years
old.</para>
<!-- SANITY-DATE -->

<para>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold places
in the community and expresses shared values and experiences.  Also as usual,
<emphasis>not</emphasis> knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)
defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish vocabulary)
possibly even a <glossterm>suit</glossterm>.  All human cultures use slang in
this threefold way &mdash; as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and
of exclusion.</para>

<para>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps in
the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard to detect
in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are code for shared
states of <emphasis>consciousness</emphasis>.  There is a whole range of
altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level hacking
which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a
Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's surreal <foreignphrase>trompe
l'oeil</foreignphrase> compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and
hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a simple
example, take the distinction between a <glossterm>kluge</glossterm> and an
<glossterm>elegant</glossterm> solution, and the differing connotations
attached to each.  The distinction is not only of engineering significance; it
reaches right back into the nature of the generative processes in program
design and asserts something important about two different kinds of
relationship between the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is unusually rich
in implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate the
hackish psyche.</para>

<para>Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive
in their use of language.  These traits seem to be common in young children,
but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an educational
system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic
invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely
unconscious process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as
a game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus display an
almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the
discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence.  Further, the electronic
media which knit them together are fluid, &lsquo;hot&rsquo; connections, well
adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of
weak and superannuated specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps
a uniquely intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.
</para>

<para>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and anthropological
assumptions.  For example, in the early 1990s it became fashionable to speak
of &lsquo;low-context&rsquo; versus &lsquo;high-context&rsquo; communication,
and to classify cultures by the preferred context level of their languages and
art forms.  It is usually claimed that low-context communication
(characterized by precision, clarity, and completeness of self-contained
utterances) is typical in cultures which value logic, objectivity,
individualism, and competition; by contrast, high-context communication
(elliptical, emotive, nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated
with cultures which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.
What then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
<quote>low-context</quote> values, but cultivates an almost absurdly
high-context slang style?</para>

<para>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a compilation
of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding culture
&mdash; and, in fact, this one is the latest version of an evolving
compilation called the &lsquo;Jargon File&rsquo;, maintained by hackers
themselves since the early 1970s.  This one (like its ancestors) is primarily
a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect background or
sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to
subsume under individual slang definitions.  </para>

<para>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that the
material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should find at
least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is amusingly
thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use humorous wordplay to
make strong, sometimes combative statements about what they feel.  Some of
these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in disputes that have been
genuinely passionate; this is deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or
pretty up these disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that
<emphasis>everyone's</emphasis> sacred cows get gored, impartially.
Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue, but the honest presentation
of divergent viewpoints is.</para>

<para>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt it either
necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too, contribute flavor,
and one of this document's major intended audiences &mdash; fledgling hackers
already partway inside the culture &mdash; will benefit from them.</para>

<para>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included in
<link linkend="appendixa">Appendix A</link>. The &lsquo;outside&rsquo;
reader's attention is particularly directed to the Portrait of J. Random
Hacker in <link linkend="appendixb">Appendix B</link>.  The <link
linkend="bibliography">Bibliography</link>, lists some non-technical works
which have either influenced or described the hacker culture.  </para>

<para>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line between
description and influence can become more than a little blurred.  Earlier
versions of the Jargon File have played a central role in spreading hacker
language and the culture that goes with it to successively larger populations,
and we hope and expect that this one will do likewise. </para>

<chapter id="distinctions"><title>Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak</title>

<para>Linguists usually refer to informal language as &lsquo;slang&rsquo; and
reserve the term &lsquo;jargon&rsquo; for the technical vocabularies of
various occupations.  However, the ancestor of this collection was called the
&lsquo;Jargon File&rsquo;, and hacker slang is traditionally &lsquo;the
jargon&rsquo;.  When talking about the jargon there is therefore no convenient
way to distinguish it from what a <emphasis>linguist</emphasis> would call
hackers' jargon &mdash; the formal vocabulary they learn from textbooks,
technical papers, and manuals.</para>

<para>To make a confused situation worse, the line between hacker slang and
the vocabulary of technical programming and computer science is fuzzy, and
shifts over time.  Further, this vocabulary is shared with a wider technical
culture of programmers, many of whom are not hackers and do not speak or
recognize hackish slang.</para>

<para>Accordingly, this lexicon will try to be as precise as the facts of
usage permit about the distinctions among three categories:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>slang</term> 
<listitem><para>informal language from mainstream English or non-technical
subcultures (bikers, rock fans, surfers, etc).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>jargon</term> 
<listitem><para>without qualifier, denotes informal &lsquo;slangy&rsquo; language
peculiar to or predominantly found among hackers &mdash; the subject of
this lexicon.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>techspeak</term> 
<listitem><para>the formal technical vocabulary of programming, computer
science, electronics, and other fields connected to hacking.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>This terminology will be consistently used throughout the remainder of
this lexicon.</para>

<para>The jargon/techspeak distinction is the delicate one.  A lot of
techspeak originated as jargon, and there is a steady continuing uptake of
jargon into techspeak.  On the other hand, a lot of jargon arises from
overgeneralization of techspeak terms (there is more about this in the <link
linkend="construction">Jargon Construction</link> section below).  </para>

<para>In general, we have considered techspeak any term that communicate
primarily by a denotation well established in textbooks, technical
dictionaries, or standards documents.</para>

<para>A few obviously techspeak terms (names of operating systems, languages,
or documents) are listed when they are tied to hacker folklore that isn't
covered in formal sources, or sometimes to convey critical historical
background necessary to understand other entries to which they are
cross-referenced.  Some other techspeak senses of jargon words are listed in
order to make the jargon senses clear; where the text does not specify that a
straight technical sense is under discussion, these are marked with
&lsquo;[techspeak]&rsquo; as an etymology.  Some entries have a primary sense
marked this way, with subsequent jargon meanings explained in terms of it.
</para>

<para>We have also tried to indicate (where known) the apparent origins of
terms.  The results are probably the least reliable information in the
lexicon, for several reasons.  For one thing, it is well known that many
hackish usages have been independently reinvented multiple times, even among
the more obscure and intricate neologisms.  It often seems that the generative
processes underlying hackish jargon formation have an internal logic so
powerful as to create substantial parallelism across separate cultures and
even in different languages!  For another, the networks tend to propagate
innovations so quickly that &lsquo;first use&rsquo; is often impossible to pin
down.  And, finally, compendia like this one alter what they observe by
implicitly stamping cultural approval on terms and widening their use.</para>

<para>Despite these problems, the organized collection of jargon-related oral
history for the new compilations has enabled us to put to rest quite a number
of folk etymologies, place credit where credit is due, and illuminate the
early history of many important hackerisms such as
<glossterm>kluge</glossterm>, <glossterm>cruft</glossterm>, and
<glossterm>foo</glossterm>.  We believe specialist lexicographers will find
many of the historical notes more than casually instructive.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id='revision-history'><title>Revision History</title>

<para>The original Jargon File was a collection of hacker jargon from
technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab (SAIL), and
others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities including Bolt, Beranek
and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic
Institute (WPI).</para>

<para>The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;jargon-1&rsquo; or
&lsquo;the File&rsquo;) was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From
this time until the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the
File was named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back
considerably earlier (<glossterm>frob</glossterm> and some senses of
<glossterm>moby</glossterm>, for instance, go back to the Tech Model Railroad
Club at MIT and are believed to date at least back to the early 1960s).  The
revisions of jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered
&lsquo;Version 1&rsquo;.</para>

<para>In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on the
SAIL computer, FTPed a copy of the File to MIT.  He
noticed that it was hardly restricted to &lsquo;AI words&rsquo; and so stored
the file on his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.</para>

<para>The file was quickly renamed JARGON > (the &lsquo;>&rsquo; caused
versioning under ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin
and Guy L.  Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody
thought of correcting the term &lsquo;jargon&rsquo; to &lsquo;slang&rsquo;
until the compendium had already become widely known as the Jargon
File.</para>

<para>Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently
kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic resynchronizations).</para>

<para>The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman
was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related
coinages.</para>

<para>In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the
File published in Stewart Brand's <citetitle>CoEvolution Quarterly</citetitle>
(issue 29, pages 26&mdash;35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele
(including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to have been the
File's first paper publication.</para>

<para>A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as
<citetitle>The Hacker's Dictionary</citetitle> (Harper &amp; Row CN 1082, ISBN
0-06-091082-8).  The other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and
Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and
Geoff Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as
&lsquo;Steele-1983&rsquo; and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.</para>

<para>Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to freeze
the file temporarily to facilitate the production of Steele-1983, but external
conditions caused the &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; freeze to become
permanent.</para>

<para>The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts
and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported hardware and
software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT, most AI work had
turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time, the commercialization of
AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best and brightest away to startups
along the Route 128 strip in Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.
The startups built LISP machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a
<glossterm>TWENEX</glossterm> system rather than a host for the AI hackers'
beloved <glossterm>ITS</glossterm>. </para>

<para>The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource until
1991.  Stanford became a major <glossterm>TWENEX</glossterm> site, at one
point operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most
of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD Unix
standard.  </para>

<para>In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the File
were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at Digital
Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers, already dispersed, moved on to
other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its authors thought
was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the time just how wide its
influence was to be.</para>

<para>By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies obtained
off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from MIT and
Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence on hacker
language and humor.  Even as the advent of the microcomputer and other trends
fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File (and related materials
such as the <link linkend="koans">Some AI Koans</link> in Appendix A) came to
be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture Matter of Britain
chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab.  The pace of change
in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously &mdash; but the Jargon File,
having passed from living document to icon, remained essentially untouched for
seven years.</para>

<para>This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after careful
consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in about 80% of the
Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very few entries
introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also obsolete.</para>

<para>This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim is
to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical computing
cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More than half of the
entries now derive from <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm> and represent jargon now
current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have been made to
collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC programmers, Amiga fans,
Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe world.</para>

<para>Eric S. Raymond <email>esr@thyrsus.com</email> maintains the new File
with assistance from Guy L. Steele Jr. <email>gls@think.com</email>; these are
the persons primarily reflected in the File's editorial &lsquo;we&rsquo;,

coauthors of Steele-1983.  Please email all additions, corrections, and
correspondence relating to the Jargon File to Eric.</para>

<para>The 2.9.6 version became the main text of <citetitle>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</citetitle>, by Eric Raymond (ed.), MIT Press 1991, ISBN
0-262-68069-6. </para>

<para>The 3.0.0 version was published in August 1993 as the second edition of
<citetitle>The New Hacker's Dictionary</citetitle>, again from MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-18154-1).</para>

<para>The 4.0.0 version was published in September 1996 as the third edition
of <citetitle>The New Hacker's Dictionary</citetitle> from MIT Press (ISBN
0-262-68092-0).</para>

<para>The maintainers are committed to updating the on-line version of the
Jargon File through and beyond paper publication, and will continue to make it
available to archives and public-access sites as a trust of the hacker
community.</para>

<para>Version numbering: Version numbers should be read as
major.minor.revision.  Major version 1 is reserved for the &lsquo;old&rsquo;

and including the second paper edition.  From now on, major version number
N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper edition.  Usually later

there is generally no point in keeping old versions around.</para>

<chapter id="construction"><title>Jargon Construction</title>

<para>There are some standard methods of jargonification that became
established quite early (i.e., before 1970), spreading from such sources as
the Tech Model Railroad Club, the PDP-1 SPACEWAR hackers, and John McCarthy's
original crew of LISPers.  These include verb doubling, soundalike slang, the
&lsquo;-P&rsquo; convention, overgeneralization, spoken inarticulations, and
anthropomorphization.  Each is discussed below.  We also cover the standard
comparatives for design quality.</para>

<para>Of these six, verb doubling, overgeneralization, anthropomorphization,
and (especially) spoken inarticulations have become quite general; but
soundalike slang is still largely confined to MIT and other large
universities, and the &lsquo;-P&rsquo; convention is found only where LISPers
flourish.</para>

<sect1 id="verb-doubling"><title>Verb Doubling</title>

<para>A standard construction in English is to double a verb and use it as an
exclamation, such as <quote>Bang, bang!</quote> or <quote>Quack,
quack!</quote>.  Most of these are names for noises.  Hackers also double
verbs as a concise, sometimes sarcastic comment on what the implied subject
does.  Also, a doubled verb is often used to terminate a conversation, in the
process remarking on the current state of affairs or what the speaker intends
to do next.  Typical examples involve <glossterm>win</glossterm>,
<glossterm>lose</glossterm>, <glossterm>hack</glossterm>,
<glossterm>flame</glossterm>, <glossterm>barf</glossterm>,
<glossterm>chomp</glossterm>:</para>

<blockquote>
<para><quote>The disk heads just crashed.</quote> <quote>Lose,
lose.</quote></para>
<para><quote>Mostly he talked about his latest crock.  Flame,
flame.</quote></para>
<para>&ldquo;Boy, what a bagbiter!  Chomp, chomp!</para>
</blockquote>

<para>Some verb-doubled constructions have special meanings not immediately
obvious from the verb.  These have their own listings in the lexicon.</para>

<para>The <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm> culture has one
<emphasis>tripling</emphasis> convention unrelated to this; the names of
&lsquo;joke&rsquo; topic groups often have a tripled last element.  The first
and paradigmatic example was <systemitem
role="newsgroup">alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</systemitem> (a
<citetitle>Muppet Show</citetitle> reference); other infamous examples have
included:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
<systemitem role="newsgroup">alt.french.captain.borg.borg.borg</systemitem>

<listitem><para>

<listitem><para>

</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>These two traditions fuse in the newsgroup <systemitem
role="newsgroup">alt.adjective.noun.verb.verb.verb</systemitem>, devoted to
humor based on deliberately confounding parts of speech.  Several observers
have noted that the contents of this group is excellently representative of
the peculiarities of hacker humor.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="soundalike-slang"><title>Soundalike Slang</title>

<para>Hackers will often make rhymes or puns in order to convert an ordinary
word or phrase into something more interesting.  It is considered particularly
<glossterm>flavorful</glossterm> if the phrase is bent so as to include some
other jargon word; thus the computer hobbyist magazine <citetitle>Dr. Dobb's
Journal</citetitle> is almost always referred to among hackers as
&lsquo;Dr. Frob's Journal&rsquo; or simply &lsquo;Dr. Frob's&rsquo;.  Terms of
this kind that have been in fairly wide use include names for
newspapers:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Boston Herald &rarr; Horrid (or Harried)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Boston Globe &rarr; Boston Glob</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Houston (or San Francisco) Chronicle &rarr; the Crocknicle (or
the Comical)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>New York Times &rarr; New York Slime</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Wall Street Journal &rarr; Wall Street
Urinal</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>However, terms like these are often made up on the spur of the moment.
Standard examples include:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Data General &rarr; Dirty Genitals</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>IBM 360 &rarr; IBM Three-Sickly</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Government Property &mdash; Do Not Duplicate (on keys) &rarr;
Government Duplicity &mdash; Do Not Propagate</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>for historical reasons &rarr; for hysterical
raisins</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Margaret Jacks Hall (the CS building at Stanford) &rarr;

<listitem><para>Microsoft &rarr; Microsloth</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Internet Explorer &rarr; Internet Exploiter</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>FrontPage &rarr; AffrontPage</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>VB.NET &rarr; VB Nyet</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Lotus Notes &rarr; Lotus Bloats</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Microsoft Outlook &rarr; Microsoft Outhouse</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Linux &rarr; Linsux</para></listitem>

hacker punning jargon is intentionally transparent.</para>

<para>Turning a word into a question by appending the syllable
&lsquo;P&rsquo;; from the LISP convention of appending the letter
&lsquo;P&rsquo; to denote a predicate (a boolean-valued function).  The

<glossterm>T</glossterm> and <glossterm>NIL</glossterm>.)</para>

whether someone would like to share with him a two-person-sized bowl of soup.
His inquiry was: <quote>Split-p soup?</quote> &mdash; GLS]</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="overgeneralization"><title>Overgeneralization</title>

<para>A very conspicuous feature of jargon is the frequency with which
techspeak items such as names of program tools, command language primitives,
and even assembler opcodes are applied to contexts outside of computing
wherever hackers find amusing analogies to them.  Thus (to cite one of the
best-known examples) Unix hackers often <glossterm>grep</glossterm> for things
rather than searching for them.  Many of the lexicon entries are
generalizations of exactly this kind.</para>

<para>Hackers enjoy overgeneralization on the grammatical level as well.  Many
hackers love to take various words and add the wrong endings to them to make
nouns and verbs, often by extending a standard rule to nonuniform cases (or
vice versa).  For example, because porous &rarr; porosity and generous &rarr;
generosity, hackers happily generalize:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>mysterious &rarr; mysteriosity</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>ferrous &rarr; ferrosity</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>obvious &rarr; obviosity</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>dubious &rarr; dubiosity</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Another class of common construction uses the suffix
&lsquo;-itude&rsquo; to abstract a quality from just about any adjective or
noun.  This usage arises especially in cases where mainstream English would
perform the same abstraction through &lsquo;-iness&rsquo; or
&lsquo;-ingness&rsquo;.  Thus:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>win &rarr; winnitude (a common exclamation)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>loss &rarr; lossitude</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>cruft &rarr; cruftitude</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>lame &rarr; lameitude</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Some hackers cheerfully reverse this transformation; they argue, for
example, that the horizontal degree lines on a globe ought to be called
&lsquo;lats&rsquo; &mdash; after all, they're measuring latitude! </para>

<para>Also, note that all nouns can be verbed.  E.g.: <quote>All nouns can be
verbed</quote>, <quote>I'll mouse it up</quote>, <quote>Hang on while I
clipboard it over</quote>, <quote>I'm grepping the files</quote>.  English as
a whole is already heading in this direction (towards pure-positional grammar
like Chinese); hackers are simply a bit ahead of the curve.</para>

<para>The suffix <quote>-full</quote> can also be applied in generalized and
fanciful ways, as in <quote>As soon as you have more than one cachefull of
data, the system starts thrashing,</quote> or <quote>As soon as I have more
than one headfull of ideas, I start writing it all down.</quote> A common use
is <quote>screenfull</quote>, meaning the amount of text that will fit on one
screen, usually in text mode where you have no choice as to character
size. Another common form is <quote>bufferfull</quote>.</para>

<para>However, hackers avoid the unimaginative verb-making techniques
characteristic of marketroids, bean-counters, and the Pentagon; a hacker would
never, for example, &lsquo;productize&rsquo;, &lsquo;prioritize&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;securitize&rsquo; things.  Hackers have a strong aversion to
bureaucratic bafflegab and regard those who use it with contempt.</para>

<para>Similarly, all verbs can be nouned.  This is only a slight
overgeneralization in modern English; in hackish, however, it is good form to
mark them in some standard nonstandard way.  Thus:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>win &rarr; winnitude, winnage</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>disgust &rarr; disgustitude</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>hack &rarr; hackification</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Further, note the prevalence of certain kinds of nonstandard plural
forms.  Some of these go back quite a ways; the TMRC Dictionary includes an
entry which implies that the plural of &lsquo;mouse&rsquo; is
<glossterm>meeces</glossterm>, and notes that the defined plural of
&lsquo;caboose&rsquo; is &lsquo;cabeese&rsquo;.  This latter has apparently
been standard (or at least a standard joke) among railfans (railroad
enthusiasts) for many years</para>

<para>On a similarly Anglo-Saxon note, almost anything ending in
&lsquo;x&rsquo; may form plurals in &lsquo;-xen&rsquo; (see
<glossterm>VAXen</glossterm> and <glossterm>boxen</glossterm> in the main
text).  Even words ending in phonetic /k/ alone are sometimes treated this
way; e.g., &lsquo;soxen&rsquo; for a bunch of socks.  Other funny plurals are
the Hebrew-style &lsquo;frobbotzim&rsquo; for the plural of
&lsquo;frobbozz&rsquo; (see <glossterm>frobnitz</glossterm>) and
&lsquo;Unices&rsquo; and &lsquo;Twenices&rsquo; (rather than
&lsquo;Unixes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Twenexes&rsquo;; see
<glossterm>Unix</glossterm>, <glossterm>TWENEX</glossterm> in main text).  But
note that &lsquo;Twenexen&rsquo; was never used, and &lsquo;Unixen&rsquo; was
seldom sighted in the wild until the year 2000, thirty years after it might
logically have come into use; it has been suggested that this is because
&lsquo;-ix&rsquo; and &lsquo;-ex&rsquo; are Latin singular endings that
attract a Latinate plural.  Among Perl hackers it is reported that
&lsquo;comma&rsquo; and &lsquo;semicolon&rsquo; pluralize as
&lsquo;commata&rsquo; and &lsquo;semicola&rsquo; respectively.  Finally, it
has been suggested to general approval that the plural of
&lsquo;mongoose&rsquo; ought to be &lsquo;polygoose&rsquo;.</para>
<!-- from John Eaton <johne@vcd.hp.com>, 15 April 1991 (polygoose) -->
<!-- from Harry Henry Gebel <hgebel@inet.net>, 02 May 2000 -->
<!-- from Chris Ball <chris@void.printf.net>, 01 Jun 2002 (commata/semicola)-->

<para>The pattern here, as with other hackish grammatical quirks, is
generalization of an inflectional rule that in English is either an import or
a fossil (such as the Hebrew plural ending &lsquo;-im&rsquo;, or the
Anglo-Saxon plural suffix &lsquo;-en&rsquo;) to cases where it isn't normally
considered to apply.</para>

<para>This is not &lsquo;poor grammar&rsquo;, as hackers are generally quite
well aware of what they are doing when they distort the language.  It is
grammatical creativity, a form of playfulness.  It is done not to impress but
to amuse, and never at the expense of clarity.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="inarticulations"><title>Spoken inarticulations</title>

<para>Words such as &lsquo;mumble&rsquo;, &lsquo;sigh&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;groan&rsquo; are spoken in places where their referent might more
naturally be used.  It has been suggested that this usage derives from the
impossibility of representing such noises on a comm link or in electronic
mail, MUDs, and IRC channels (interestingly, the same sorts of constructions
have been showing up with increasing frequency in comic strips).  Another
expression sometimes heard is <quote>Complain!</quote>, meaning <quote>I have
a complaint!</quote></para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="anthropomorphization"><title>Anthropomorphization</title>

<para>Semantically, one rich source of jargon constructions is the hackish
tendency to anthropomorphize hardware and software.  English purists and
academic computer scientists frequently look down on others for
anthropomorphizing hardware and software, considering this sort of behavior to
be characteristic of naive misunderstanding. But most hackers anthropomorphize
freely, frequently describing program behavior in terms of wants and
desires.</para>

<para>Thus it is common to hear hardware or software talked about as though it
has homunculi talking to each other inside it, with intentions and desires.
Thus, one hears <quote>The protocol handler got confused</quote>, or that
programs <quote>are trying</quote> to do things, or one may say of a routine
that <quote>its goal in life is to X</quote>.  Or: <quote>You can't run those
two cards on the same bus; they fight over interrupt 9.</quote></para>

<para>One even hears explanations like &ldquo;&ellipsis; and its poor little
brain couldn't understand X, and it died.&rdquo; Sometimes modelling things
this way actually seems to make them easier to understand, perhaps because
it's instinctively natural to think of anything with a really complex
behavioral repertoire as &lsquo;like a person&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;like a
thing&rsquo;.</para>

<para>At first glance, to anyone who understands how these programs actually
work, this seems like an absurdity.  As hackers are among the people who know
best how these phenomena work, it seems odd that they would use language that
seems to ascribe consciousness to them.  The mind-set behind this tendency
thus demands examination.</para>

<para>The key to understanding this kind of usage is that it isn't done in a
naive way; hackers don't personalize their stuff in the sense of feeling
empathy with it, nor do they mystically believe that the things they work on
every day are &lsquo;alive&rsquo;.  To the contrary: hackers who
anthropomorphize are expressing not a vitalistic view of program behavior but
a mechanistic view of human behavior.</para>

<para>Almost all hackers subscribe to the mechanistic, materialistic ontology
of science (this is in practice true even of most of the minority with
contrary religious theories).  In this view, people are biological machines
&mdash; consciousness is an interesting and valuable epiphenomenon, but mind is
implemented in machinery which is not fundamentally different in
information-processing capacity from computers.  </para>

<para>Hackers tend to take this a step further and argue that the difference
between a substrate of CHON atoms and water and a substrate of silicon and
metal is a relatively unimportant one; what matters, what makes a thing
&lsquo;alive&rsquo;, is information and richness of pattern. This is animism
from the flip side; it implies that humans and computers and dolphins and
rocks are all machines exhibiting a continuum of modes of
&lsquo;consciousness&rsquo; according to their information-processing
capacity.</para>

<para>Because hackers accept that a human machine can have intentions, it is
therefore easy for them to ascribe consciousness and intention to other
complex patterned systems such as computers.  If consciousness is mechanical,
it is neither more or less absurd to say that <quote>The program wants to go
into an infinite loop</quote> than it is to say that <quote>I want to go eat
some chocolate</quote> &mdash; and even defensible to say that <quote>The
stone, once dropped, wants to move towards the center of the
earth</quote>.</para>

<para>This viewpoint has respectable company in academic philosophy.  Daniel
Dennett organizes explanations of behavior using three stances: the
<quote>physical stance</quote> (thing-to-be-explained as a physical object),
the <quote>design stance</quote> (thing-to-be-explained as an artifact), and
the <quote>intentional stance</quote> (thing-to-be-explained as an agent with
desires and intentions).  Which stances are appropriate is a matter not of
abstract truth but of utility.  Hackers typically view simple programs from
the design stance, but more complex ones are often modelled using the
intentional stance.</para>

<para>It has also been argued that the anthropomorphization of software and
hardware reflects a blurring of the boundary between the programmer and his
artifacts &mdash; the human qualities belong to the programmer and the code merely
expresses these qualities as his/her proxy.  On this view, a hacker saying a
piece of code &lsquo;got confused&rsquo; is really saying that
<emphasis>he</emphasis> (or she) was confused about exactly what he wanted the
computer to do, the code naturally incorporated this confusion, and the code
expressed the programmer's confusion when executed by crashing or otherwise
misbehaving.  </para>

<para>Note that by displacing from <quote>I got confused</quote> to <quote>It
got confused</quote>, the programmer is not avoiding responsibility, but
rather getting some analytical distance in order to be able to consider the
bug dispassionately.</para>

<para>It has also been suggested that anthropomorphizing complex systems is
actually an expression of humility, a way of acknowleging that simple rules we
do understand (or that we invented) can lead to emergent behavioral
complexities that we don't completely understand.</para>

<para>All three explanations accurately model hacker psychology, and should be
considered complementary rather than competing.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="comparatives"><title>Comparatives</title>

<para>Finally, note that many words in hacker jargon have to be understood as
members of sets of comparatives.  This is especially true of the adjectives
and nouns used to describe the beauty and functional quality of code.  Here is
an approximately correct spectrum:</para>

<para>monstrosity brain-damage screw bug lose misfeature crock kluge hack win
feature elegance perfection</para>

<para>The last is spoken of as a mythical absolute, approximated but never
actually attained.  Another similar scale is used for describing the
reliability of software:</para>

<para>broken flaky dodgy fragile brittle solid robust bulletproof
armor-plated</para>

<para>Note, however, that &lsquo;dodgy&rsquo; is primarily Commonwealth
Hackish (it is rare in the U.S., where &lsquo;squirrelly&rsquo; may be more
common) and may change places with &lsquo;flaky&rsquo; for some
speakers.</para>

<para>Coinages for describing <glossterm>lossage</glossterm> seem to call
forth the very finest in hackish linguistic inventiveness; it has been truly
said that hackers have even more words for equipment failures than Yiddish has
for obnoxious people.  </para>
</sect1>
</chapter>

<chapter id='writing-style'><title>Hacker Writing Style</title>

<para>We've already seen that hackers often coin jargon by overgeneralizing
grammatical rules.  This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in hackish
writing.  One correspondent reports that he consistently misspells
&lsquo;wrong&rsquo; as &lsquo;worng&rsquo;.  Others have been known to
criticize glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas
Hofstadter) <quote>This sentence no verb</quote>, or <quote>Too
repetetetive</quote>, or <quote>Bad speling</quote>, or <quote>Incorrectspa
cing.</quote> Similarly, intentional spoonerisms are often made of phrases
relating to confusion or things that are confusing; &lsquo;dain bramage&rsquo;
for &lsquo;brain damage&rsquo; is perhaps the most common (similarly, a hacker
would be likely to write <quote>Excuse me, I'm cixelsyd today</quote>, rather
than <quote>I'm dyslexic today</quote>).  This sort of thing is quite common
and is enjoyed by all concerned.</para>

<para>Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much
to the dismay of American editors.  Thus, if <quote>Jim is going</quote> is a
phrase, and so are <quote>Bill runs</quote> and <quote>Spock groks</quote>,
then hackers generally prefer to write: <quote>Jim is going</quote>,
<quote>Bill runs</quote>, and <quote>Spock groks</quote>.  This is incorrect
according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas
and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is
counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that
don't belong in them.  Given the sorts of examples that can come up in
discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly
misleading.  When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra
characters can be a real pain in the neck.</para>

<para>Consider, for example, a sentence in a <glossterm>vi</glossterm>
tutorial that looks like this:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>Then delete a line from the file by typing <quote>dd</quote>.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>Standard usage would make this</para>

<blockquote>
<para>Then delete a line from the file by typing <quote>dd.</quote></para>
</blockquote>

<para>but that would be very bad &mdash; because the reader would be prone to
type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vi</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
dot repeats the last command accepted.  The net result would be to delete
<emphasis>two</emphasis> lines!</para>

<para>The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.</para>

<para>Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain, though the older style (which became established for typographical
reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text)
is still accepted there.  <citetitle>Hart's Rules</citetitle> and the
<citetitle>Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors</citetitle> call the
hacker-like style &lsquo;new&rsquo; or &lsquo;logical&rsquo; quoting.  This
returns British English to the style many other languages (including Spanish,
French, Italian, Catalan, and German) have been using all along.</para>

<para>Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between
&lsquo;scare&rsquo; quotes and &lsquo;speech&rsquo; quotes; that is, to use
British-style single quotes for marking and reserve American-style double
quotes for actual reports of speech or text included from elsewhere.
Interestingly, some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but
mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes indiscriminately
enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this was a
personal quirk of mine until I checked with Usenet &mdash;ESR] One further
permutation that is definitely <emphasis>not</emphasis> standard is a hackish
tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes (single quotes) in pairs;
that is, &rsquo;like this&rsquo;.  This is modelled on string and character
literal syntax in some programming languages (reinforced by the fact that many
character-only terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter style, as a
vertical single quote).</para>

<para>One quirk that shows up frequently in the <glossterm>email</glossterm>
style of Unix hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are
normally all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C
routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning of
sentences.  It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such identifiers
becomes a part of their internal representation (the &lsquo;spelling&rsquo;)
and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an appropriate reflex because
Unix and C both distinguish cases and confusing them can lead to
<glossterm>lossage</glossterm>).  A way of escaping this dilemma is simply to
avoid using these constructions at the beginning of sentences.</para>

<para>There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the
effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance to
traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or lose information they
can be discarded without a second thought.  It is notable in this respect that
other hackish inventions (for example, in vocabulary) also tend to carry very
precise shades of meaning even when constructed to appear slangy and loose.
In fact, to a hacker, the contrast between &lsquo;loose&rsquo; form and
&lsquo;tight&rsquo; content in jargon is a substantial part of its
humor!</para>

<para>Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and these
are occasionally carried over into written documents even when normal means of
font changes, underlining, and the like are available.</para>

<para>One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS
&lsquo;LOUD&rsquo;, and this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that
a person who goes to caps-lock while in <glossterm>talk mode</glossterm> may
be asked to <quote>stop shouting, please, you're hurting my
ears!</quote>.</para>

<para>Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to signify
emphasis.  The asterisk is most common, as in <quote>What the *hell*?</quote>
even though this interferes with the common use of the asterisk suffix as a
footnote mark.  The underscore is also common, suggesting underlining (this is
particularly common with book titles; for example, <quote>It is often alleged
that Joe Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's
earlier novel of the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.</quote>).  Other
forms exemplified by <quote>=hell=</quote>, <quote>\hell/</quote>, or
<quote>/hell/</quote> are occasionally seen (it's claimed that in the last
example the first slash pushes the letters over to the right to make them
italic, and the second keeps them from falling over).  On FidoNet, you might
see #bright# and ^dark^ text, which was actually interpreted by some reader
software.  Finally, words may also be emphasized L I K E T H I S, or by a
series of carets (^) under them on the next line of the text.</para> 
<!-- from Thomas Newton <tom@south-of-heaven.demon.co.uk>, 16 Jul 1998 -->

<para>There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a very young
child or a mentally impaired person).  Bracketing a word with the
&lsquo;*&rsquo; character may also indicate that the writer wishes readers to
consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is being made.
Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*, *mumble*.</para>

<para>One might also see the above sound effects as &lt;bang&gt;, &lt;hic&gt;,
&lt;ring&gt;, &lt;grin&gt;, &lt;kick&gt;, &lt;stomp&gt;, &lt;mumble&gt;.  This
use of angle brackets to mark their contents originally derives from
conventions used in <glossterm>BNF</glossterm>, but since about 1993 it has
been reinforced by the HTML markup used on the World Wide Web.</para>

<para>Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands for
some <glossterm>random</glossterm> member of a larger class (this is straight
from <glossterm>BNF</glossterm>). Examples like the following are common:
</para>

<blockquote>
<para>So this &lt;ethnic&gt; walks into a bar one day...</para>
</blockquote>

<para>There is also an accepted convention for &lsquo;writing under
erasure&rsquo;; the text></para>

<blockquote>
<para>Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman, he's visiting from corporate
HQ.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>reads roughly as &ldquo;Be nice to this fool, er,
gentleman&ellipsis;&rdquo;, with irony emphasized.  The digraph ^H is often
used as a print representation for a backspace, and was actually very visible
on old-style printing terminals. As the text was being composed the characters
would be echoed and printed immediately, and when a correction was made the
backspace keystrokes would be echoed with the string &lsquo;^H&rsquo;.  Of
course, the final composed text would have no trace of the backspace
characters (or the original erroneous text).</para>

<para>Accidental writing under erasure occurs when using the Unix
<command>talk</command> program to chat interactively to another user. On a
PC-style keyboard most users instinctively press the backspace key to delete
mistakes, but this may not achieve the desired effect, and merely displays a
^H symbol. The user typically presses backspace a few times before their brain
realises the problem &mdash; especially likely if the user is a touch-typist
&mdash; and since each character is transmitted as soon as it is typed,
Freudian slips and other inadvertent admissions are (barring network delays)
clearly visible for the other user to see.</para>

<para>Deliberate use of ^H for writing under erasure parallels (and may have
been influenced by) the ironic use of &lsquo;slashouts&rsquo; in
science-fiction fanzines.</para>

<para>A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to previous
text.  This custom faded in email as more mailers got good editing
capabilities, only to take on new life on IRCs and other line-based chat
systems.</para>

<screen>
charlie: I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often. 
lisa: Send it to Erik for the File.
lisa: Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.
</screen>

<para>The s/Erik/Eric/ says <quote>change Erik to Eric in the
preceding</quote>.  This syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools
<command>ed</command> and <command>sed</command>, but is widely recognized by
non-Unix hackers as well. </para>

<para>In a formula, * signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a row are
a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN, and is also used in
Ada).  Thus, one might write 2 ** 8 = 256.</para>

<para>Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead 2^8 = 256.  This goes all
the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII &lsquo;up-arrow&rsquo;
that later became the caret; this was picked up by Kemeny and Kurtz's original
BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>bc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
and
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>dc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
Unix tools, which have probably done most to reinforce the convention on
Usenet. (TeX math mode also uses ^ for exponention.) The notation is mildly
confusing to C programmers, because ^ means bitwise exclusive-or in C.
Despite this, it was favored 3:1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of Usenet.
It is used consistently in this lexicon.</para>

<para>In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions (&lsquo;3.5&rsquo; or &lsquo;7/2&rsquo;) rather than
&lsquo;typewriter style&rsquo; mixed fractions (&lsquo;3-1/2&rsquo;).  The
major motive here is probably that the former are more readable in a
monospaced font, together with a desire to avoid the risk that the latter
might be read as &lsquo;three minus one-half&rsquo;.  The decimal form is
definitely preferred for fractions with a terminating decimal representation;
there may be some cultural influence here from the high status of scientific
notation.</para>

<para>Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very small
numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN).  This is a form of
&lsquo;scientific notation&rsquo; using &lsquo;e&rsquo; to replace
&lsquo;*10^&rsquo;; for example, one year is about 3e7 (that is, 3 &times; 10
<superscript>7</superscript>) seconds long.</para>

<para>The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
&lsquo;approximately&rsquo;; that is, <literal>~50</literal> means
&lsquo;about fifty&rsquo;.</para>

<para>On Usenet and in the <glossterm>MUD</glossterm> world, common C boolean,
logical, and relational operators such as <literal>|</literal>,
<literal>&amp;</literal>, <literal>||</literal>,
<literal>&amp;&amp;</literal>, <literal>!</literal>, <literal>==</literal>,
<literal>!=</literal>, <literal>></literal>, <literal>&lt;</literal>,
<literal>&gt;=</literal>, and <literal>&lt;=</literal> are often combined with
English.  The Pascal not-equals, <literal>&lt;&gt;</literal>, is also
recognized, and occasionally one sees <literal>/=</literal> for not-equals
(from Ada, Common Lisp, and Fortran 90).  The use of prefix &lsquo;!&rsquo; as
a loose synonym for &lsquo;not-&rsquo; or &lsquo;no-&rsquo; is particularly
common; thus, &lsquo;!clue&rsquo; is read &lsquo;no-clue&rsquo; or
&lsquo;clueless&rsquo;. </para>

<para>A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages
to express ideas in a natural-language text.  For example, one might see the
following:</para>

<!-- from Jouni Seppanen <Jouni.Seppanen@Helsinki.FI>, 14 Jan 96 -->

<para>Another recent (late 1990s) construction now common on Usenet seems to
be borrowed from Unix shell syntax or Perl.  It consists of using a dollar
sign before an uppercased form of a word or acronym to suggest any
<glossterm>random</glossterm> member of the class indicated by the word.
Thus: &lsquo;$PHB&rsquo; means <quote>any random member of the class
&lsquo;Pointy-Haired Boss&rsquo;</quote>.</para>

<para>Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage.  In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit sequence
where you intend the reader to understand the text string that names that
number in English.  So, hackers prefer to write &lsquo;1970s&rsquo; rather
than &lsquo;nineteen-seventies&rsquo; or &lsquo;1970's&rsquo; (the latter
looks like a possessive).</para>

<para>It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use
multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English.  Part of this is almost
certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply nested parentheses
(like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has also been suggested that a
more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with complexity and pushing
systems to their limits is in operation.</para>

<para>Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line
communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting effect on
people.  Deprived of the body-language cues through which emotional state is
expressed, people tend to forget everything about other parties except what is
presented over that ASCII link.  This has both good and bad effects.  A good
one is that it encourages honesty and tends to break down hierarchical
authority relationships; a bad one is that it may encourage depersonalization
and gratuitous rudeness.  Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters
often display a sort of conscious formal
<foreignphrase>politesse</foreignphrase> in their writing that has passed out
of fashion in other spoken and written media (for example, the phrase
<quote>Well said, sir!</quote> is not uncommon).</para>

<para>Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely because
they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing with people and
thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would face to face.</para>

<para>Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and clarity of
expression.  It may well be that future historians of literature will see in
it a revival of the great tradition of personal letters as art.</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="email-style"><title>Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions</title>

<para>One area where conventions for on-line writing are still in some flux is
the marking of included material from earlier messages &mdash; what would be
called &lsquo;block quotations&rsquo; in ordinary English.  From the usual
typographic convention employed for these (smaller font at an extra indent),
there derived a practice of included text being indented by one ASCII TAB
(0001001) character, which under Unix and many other environments gives the
appearance of an 8-space indent.</para>

<para>Early mail and netnews readers had no facility for including messages
this way, so people had to paste in copy manually.  BSD
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>Mail</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> was the first message agent to support inclusion,
and early Usenetters emulated its style.  But the TAB character tended to push
included text too far to the right (especially in multiply nested inclusions),
leading to ugly wraparounds.  After a brief period of confusion (during which
an inclusion leader consisting of three or four spaces became established in
EMACS and a few mailers), the use of leading <literal>&gt;</literal> or
<literal>&gt; </literal> became standard, perhaps owing to its use in
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ed</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> to display tabs (alternatively, it may derive from
the <literal>&gt;</literal> that some early Unix mailers used to quote lines
starting with "From" in text, so they wouldn't look like the beginnings of new
message headers).  Inclusions within inclusions keep their
<literal>&gt;</literal> leaders, so the &lsquo;nesting level' of a quotation
is visually apparent.</para>

<para>The practice of including text from the parent article when posting a
followup helped solve what had been a major nuisance on Usenet: the fact that
articles do not arrive at different sites in the same order.  Careless posters
used to post articles that would begin with, or even consist entirely of,
<quote>No, that's wrong</quote> or <quote>I agree</quote> or the like.  It was
hard to see who was responding to what.  Consequently, around 1984, new
news-posting software evolved a facility to automatically include the text of
a previous article, marked with &ldquo;&gt; &rdquo; or whatever the poster
chose.  The poster was expected to delete all but the relevant lines.  The
result has been that, now, careless posters post articles containing the
<emphasis>entire</emphasis> text of a preceding article,
<emphasis>followed</emphasis> only by <quote>No, that's wrong</quote> or
<quote>I agree</quote>.</para>

<para>Many people feel that this cure is worse than the original disease, and
there soon appeared newsreader software designed to let the reader skip over
included text if desired.  Today, some posting software rejects articles
containing too high a proportion of lines beginning with &lsquo;&gt;' &mdash;
but this too has led to undesirable workarounds, such as the deliberate
inclusion of zero-content filler lines which aren't quoted and thus pull the
message below the rejection threshold.</para>

<para>Inclusion practice is still evolving, and disputes over the
&lsquo;correct&rsquo; inclusion style occasionally lead to
<glossterm>holy wars</glossterm>.</para>

<para>Most netters view an inclusion as a promise that comment on it will
immediately follow.  The preferred, conversational style looks like
this,</para>

<literallayout>
     &gt; relevant excerpt 1
     response to excerpt
     &gt; relevant excerpt 2
     response to excerpt
     &gt; relevant excerpt 3
     response to excerpt
</literallayout>

<para>or for short messages like this:</para>

<literallayout>
     &gt; entire message
     response to message
</literallayout>

<para>Thanks to poor design of some PC-based mail agents (notably Microsoft
Outlook and Outlook Express), one will occasionally see the entire quoted
message <emphasis>after</emphasis> the response, like this</para>

<literallayout>
     response to message
     &gt; entire message
</literallayout>

<para>but this practice is strongly deprecated.</para>

<para>Though <literal>&gt;</literal> remains the standard inclusion leader,
<literal>|</literal> is occasionally used for extended quotations where
original variations in indentation are being retained (one mailer even
combines these and uses <literal>|&gt;</literal>).  One also sees different
styles of quoting a number of authors in the same message: one (deprecated
because it loses information) uses a leader of <literal>&gt; </literal> for
everyone, another (the most common) is <literal>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</literal>, <literal>&gt; &gt; &gt; </literal>, etc. (or
<literal>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </literal>, <literal>&gt;&gt;&gt;</literal>, etc.,
depending on line length and nesting depth) reflecting the original order of
messages, and yet another is to use a different citation leader for each
author, say <literal>> </literal>, <literal>: </literal>, <literal>|
</literal>, <literal>@</literal> (preserving nesting so that the inclusion
order of messages is still apparent, or tagging the inclusions with authors'
names).  Yet <emphasis>another</emphasis> style is to use each poster's
initials (or login name) as a citation leader for that poster.</para>

<para>Occasionally one sees a <literal># </literal> leader used for quotations
from authoritative sources such as standards documents; the intended allusion
is to the root prompt (the special Unix command prompt issued when one is
running as the privileged super-user).</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id='speech-style'><title>Hacker Speech Style</title>

<para>Hackish speech generally features extremely precise diction, careful
word choice, a relatively large working vocabulary, and relatively little use
of contractions or street slang.  Dry humor, irony, puns, and a mildly
flippant attitude are highly valued &mdash; but an underlying seriousness and
intelligence are essential.  One should use just enough jargon to communicate
precisely and identify oneself as a member of the culture; overuse of jargon
or a breathless, excessively gung-ho attitude is considered tacky and the mark
of a loser.</para>

<para>This speech style is a variety of the precisionist English normally
spoken by scientists, design engineers, and academics in technical fields.  In
contrast with the methods of jargon construction, it is fairly constant
throughout hackerdom.</para>

<para>It has been observed that many hackers are confused by negative
questions &mdash; or, at least, that the people to whom they are talking are
often confused by the sense of their answers.  The problem is that they have
done so much programming that distinguishes between</para>

<programlisting>
if (going) ...
</programlisting>

<para>and</para>

<programlisting>
if (!going) ...
</programlisting>

<para>that when they parse the question <quote>Aren't you going?</quote> it
may seem to be asking the opposite question from <quote>Are you
going?</quote>, and so to merit an answer in the opposite sense.  This
confuses English-speaking non-hackers because they were taught to answer as
though the negative part weren't there.  In some other languages (including
Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) the hackish interpretation is standard and the
problem wouldn't arise.  Hackers often find themselves wishing for a word like
French &lsquo;si&rsquo;, German &lsquo;doch&rsquo;, or Dutch
&lsquo;jawel&rsquo; &mdash; a word with which one could unambiguously answer
&lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a negative question.  (See also
<glossterm>mu</glossterm>)</para>
<!-- from Toon Knapen <Toon.Knapen@lms.be>, 19 Apr 1999 -->

<para>For similar reasons, English-speaking hackers almost never use double
negatives, even if they live in a region where colloquial usage allows them.
The thought of uttering something that logically ought to be an affirmative
knowing it will be misparsed as a negative tends to disturb them.</para>
  
<para>In a related vein, hackers sometimes make a game of answering questions
containing logical connectives with a strictly literal rather than colloquial
interpretation.  A non-hacker who is indelicate enough to ask a question like
<quote>So, are you working on finding that bug <emphasis>now</emphasis> or
leaving it until later?</quote> is likely to get the perfectly correct answer
<quote>Yes!</quote> (that is, <quote>Yes, I'm doing it either now or later,
and you didn't ask which!</quote>).</para>

<chapter id='international-style'><title>International Style</title>

<para>Although the Jargon File remains primarily a lexicon of hacker usage in
American English, we have made some effort to get input from abroad.  Though
the hacker-speak of other languages often uses translations of jargon from
English (often as transmitted to them by earlier Jargon File versions!), the
local variations are interesting, and knowledge of them may be of some use to
travelling hackers.</para>

<para>There are some references herein to &lsquo;Commonwealth hackish&rsquo;.
These are intended to describe some variations in hacker usage as reported in
the English spoken in Great Britain and the Commonwealth (Canada, Australia,
India, etc. &mdash; though Canada is heavily influenced by American usage).
There is also an entry on <glossterm>Commonwealth Hackish</glossterm>
reporting some general phonetic and vocabulary differences from
U.S. hackish.</para>

<para>Hackers in Western Europe and (especially) Scandinavia report that they
often use a mixture of English and their native languages for technical
conversation.  Occasionally they develop idioms in their English usage that
are influenced by their native-language styles.  Some of these are reported
here.</para>

<para>On the other hand, English often gives rise to grammatical and
vocabulary mutations in the native language.  For example, Italian hackers
often use the nonexistent verbs &lsquo;scrollare&rsquo; (to scroll) and
&lsquo;deletare&rsquo; (to delete) rather than native Italian
<foreignphrase>scorrere</foreignphrase> and
<foreignphrase>cancellare</foreignphrase>.  Similarly, the English verb
&lsquo;to hack&rsquo; has been seen conjugated in Swedish.  In German, many
Unix terms in English are casually declined as if they were German verbs --
thus: mount/mounten/gemountet; grep/grepen/gegrept; fork/forken/geforkt; core
dump/core-dumpen, gecoredumpt.  And Spanish-speaking hackers use
&lsquo;linkear&rsquo; (to link), &lsquo;debugear&rsquo; (to debug), and
&lsquo;lockear&rsquo; (to lock).</para>
<!-- from Matt Bonner <mattb@bpo.hp.com>, 26 Mar 1999 -->
<!-- from Cove Schneider <cove@nbn.com>, 15 Feb 2000 -->
<!-- from Maria Sultanita <mgm@sultanita.com>, 25 Jun 2001 -->

<para>European hackers report that this happens partly because the English
terms make finer distinctions than are available in their native vocabularies,
and partly because deliberate language-crossing makes for amusing
wordplay.</para>

<para>A few notes on hackish usages in Russian have been added where they are
parallel with English idioms and thus comprehensible to
English-speakers.</para>

<chapter id='crackers'><title>Crackers, Phreaks, and Lamers</title>

<para>From the early 1980s onward, a flourishing culture of local,
MS-DOS-based bulletin boards developed separately from Internet hackerdom.
The BBS culture has, as its seamy underside, a stratum of &lsquo;pirate
boards&rsquo; inhabited by <glossterm>cracker</glossterm>s, phone phreaks, and
<glossterm>warez d00dz</glossterm>.  These people (mostly teenagers running
IBM-PC clones from their bedrooms) have developed their own characteristic
jargon, heavily influenced by skateboard lingo and underground-rock slang.
While BBS technology essentially died out after the 
<glossterm>Great Internet Explosion</glossterm>, the cracker culture
moved to IRC and other Internet-based network channels and maintained a
semi-underground existence.</para>

<para>Though crackers often call themselves &lsquo;hackers&rsquo;, they aren't
(they typically have neither significant programming ability, nor Internet
expertise, nor experience with UNIX or other true multi-user systems).  Their
vocabulary has little overlap with hackerdom's, and hackers regard them with
varying degrees of contempt.  But ten years on the brightest crackers tend to
become hackers, and sometimes to recall their origins by using cracker slang
in a marked and heavily ironic way.</para>

<para>This lexicon covers much of cracker slang (which is often called
<quote>leet-speak</quote>) so the reader will be able to understand both what
leaks out of the cracker underground and the occasional ironic use by
hackers.</para>

<para>Here is a brief guide to cracker and <glossterm>warez d00dz</glossterm>
usage:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Misspell frequently.  The substitutions phone &rarr; fone and
freak &rarr; phreak are obligatory.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Always substitute &lsquo;z&rsquo;s for &lsquo;s&rsquo;s.
(i.e. <quote>codes</quote> &rarr; <quote>codez</quote>).  The substitution of
&lsquo;z&rsquo; for &lsquo;s&rsquo; has evolved so that a &lsquo;z&rsquo; is
now systematically put at the end of words to denote an illegal or cracking
connection. Examples : Appz, passwordz, passez, utilz, MP3z, distroz, pornz,
sitez, gamez, crackz, serialz, downloadz, FTPz, etc.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Type random emphasis characters after a post line
(i.e. <quote>Hey Dudes!#!$#$!#!$</quote>).  </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Use the emphatic &lsquo;k&rsquo; prefix
(<quote>k-kool</quote>, <quote>k-rad</quote>, <quote>k-awesome</quote>)
frequently.  </para></listitem>

<listitem><para> Abbreviate compulsively (<quote>I got lotsa warez w/
docs</quote>).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
TYPE ALL IN CAPS LOCK, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE YELLING ALL THE TIME.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The following letter substitutions are common:</para>

<literallayout>
    a &rarr; 4
    e &rarr; 3
    f &rarr; ph
    i &rarr; 1 or |
    l &rarr; | or 1
    m &rarr; |\/|
    n &rarr; |\|
    o &rarr; 0
    s &rarr; 5
    t &rarr; 7 or +
</literallayout>

<para>Thus, <quote>elite</quote> comes out <quote>31337</quote> and <quote>all
your base are belong to us</quote> becomes <quote>4ll y0ur b4s3 4r3 b3l0ng t0
us</quote>, Other less common substitutions include:</para>

<literallayout>
    b &rarr; 8
    c &rarr; ( or k or |&lt; or /&lt;
    d &rarr; &lt;|
    g &rarr; 6 or 9
    h &rarr; |-|
    k &rarr; |&lt; or /&lt;
    p &rarr; |2
    u &rarr; |_|
    v &rarr; / or \/
    w &rarr; // or \/\/
    x &rarr; &gt;&lt;
    y &rarr; '/
</literallayout>

<para>The word <quote>cool</quote> is spelled <quote>kewl</quote> and normally
used ironically; when crackers really want to praise something they use the
prefix <quote>uber</quote> (from German) which comes out <quote>ub3r</quote>
or even <quote>|_|83r</quote></para>

<para>These traits are similar to those of <glossterm>B1FF</glossterm>, who
originated as a parody of naive <glossterm>BBS</glossterm> users; also of his
latter-day equivalent <glossterm>Jeff K.</glossterm>.  Occasionally, this sort
of distortion may be used as heavy sarcasm or ironically by a real hacker, as
in:</para>

<screen>
    &gt; I got X Windows running under Linux!

    d00d!  u R an 31337 hax0r
</screen>

<para>The words <quote>hax0r</quote> for <quote>hacker</quote> and
<quote>sux0r</quote> for <quote>sucks</quote> are the most common references;
more generally, to mark a term as cracker-speak one may add <quote>0r</quote>
or <quote>xor</quote>.  Examples:</para>

<literallayout>
    <quote>The nightly build is sux0r today.</quote>
    <quote>Gotta go reboot those b0x0rz.</quote>
    <quote>Man, I really ought to fix0r my .fetchmailrc.</quote>
    <quote>Yeah, well he's a 'leet VMS operat0r now, so he's too good for us.</quote>
</literallayout>

<para>The only practice resembling this in native hacker usage is the
substitution of a dollar sign of &lsquo;s&rsquo; in names of products or
service felt to be excessively expensive, e.g. Compu$erve, Micro$oft.</para>

<chapter id='pronunciation'><title>Pronunciation Guide</title>

<para>Pronunciation keys are provided in the jargon listings for all entries
that are neither dictionary words pronounced as in standard English nor
obvious compounds thereof.  Slashes bracket phonetic pronunciations, which are
to be interpreted using the following conventions:</para>

<para>Syllables are hyphen-separated, except that an accent or back-accent
follows each accented syllable (the back-accent marks a secondary accent in
some words of four or more syllables).  If no accent is given, the word is
pronounced with equal accentuation on all syllables (this is common for
abbreviations).</para>

<para>Consonants are pronounced as in American English.  The letter
&lsquo;g&rsquo; is always hard (as in <quote>got</quote> rather than
<quote>giant</quote>); &lsquo;ch&rsquo; is soft (<quote>church</quote> rather
than <quote>chemist</quote>).  The letter &lsquo;j&rsquo; is the sound that
occurs twice in <quote>judge</quote>.  The letter &lsquo;s&rsquo; is always as
in <quote>pass</quote>, never a z sound.  The digraph &lsquo;kh&rsquo; is the
guttural of <quote>loch</quote> or <quote>l'chaim</quote>.  The digraph
&lsquo;gh&rsquo; is the aspirated g+h of <quote>bughouse</quote> or
<quote>ragheap</quote> (rare in English).  <!-- The digraph &lsquo;dh&rsquo;
is the voiced th (edh) of &lsquo;these clothes&rsquo;, not the --> <!--
unvoiced th (thorn) of &lsquo;thick&rsquo;. --> </para>

<para>Uppercase letters are pronounced as their English letter names; thus
(for example) <emphasis role="pronunciation">/H-L-L/</emphasis> is equivalent
to <emphasis role="pronunciation">/aych el el/</emphasis>.  <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/Z/</emphasis> may be pronounced <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/zee/</emphasis> or <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/zed/</emphasis> depending on your local dialect.</para>

<para>Vowels are represented as follows:</para>

<para>The glyph <emphasis role="pronunciation">/&schwa;/</emphasis> is used
for the &lsquo;schwa&rsquo; sound of unstressed or occluded vowels.</para>

<para>The schwa vowel is omitted in syllables containing vocalic r, l, m or n;
that is, &lsquo;kitten&rsquo; and &lsquo;color&rsquo; would be rendered
<emphasis role="pronunciation">/kit'n/</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/kuhl'r/</emphasis>, not <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/kit'&schwa;n/</emphasis> and <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/kuhl'&schwa;r/</emphasis>.</para>

<para>Note that the above table reflects mainly distinctions found in standard
American English (that is, the neutral dialect spoken by TV network announcers
and typical of educated speech in the Upper Midwest, Chicago,
Minneapolis/St. Paul and Philadelphia).  However, we separate <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/o/</emphasis> from <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/ah/</emphasis>, which tend to merge in standard
American.  This may help readers accustomed to accents resembling British
Received Pronunciation.</para>

<para>The intent of this scheme is to permit as many readers as possible to
map the pronunciations into their local dialect by ignoring some subset of the
distinctions we make.  Speakers of British RP, for example, can smash terminal
<emphasis role="pronunciation">/r/</emphasis> and all unstressed vowels.
Speakers of many varieties of southern American will automatically map
<emphasis role="pronunciation">/o/</emphasis> to <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/aw/</emphasis>; and so forth.  (Standard American makes
a good reference dialect for this purpose because it has crisp consonants and
more vowel distinctions than other major dialects, and tends to retain
distinctions between unstressed vowels.  It also happens to be what your
editor speaks.)</para>

<para>Entries with a pronunciation of &lsquo;//&rsquo; are written-only
usages.  (No, Unix weenies, this does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean
&lsquo;pronounce like previous pronunciation&rsquo;!)</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id='conventions'><title>Other Lexicon Conventions</title>

<para>Entries are sorted in case-blind ASCII collation order (rather than the
letter-by-letter order ignoring interword spacing common in mainstream
dictionaries), except that all entries beginning with nonalphabetic characters
are sorted before A, except that leading dash is ignored.  The case-blindness
is a feature, not a bug.</para>

<para>Prefix ** is used as linguists do; to mark examples of incorrect
usage.</para>

<para>We follow the &lsquo;logical&rsquo; quoting convention described in the
Writing Style section above.  In addition, we reserve double quotes for actual
excerpts of text or (sometimes invented) speech.  Scare quotes (which mark a
word being used in a nonstandard way), and philosopher's quotes (which turn an
utterance into the string of letters or words that name it) are both rendered
with single quotes.</para>

<para>References such as
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>malloc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
and
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>patch</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
are to Unix facilities (some of which, such as
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>patch</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
are actually open source distributed over Usenet). The Unix manuals use
<literal>foo(n)</literal> to refer to item foo in section
(<literal>n</literal>) of the manual, where
<literal>n=1</literal> is utilities,
<literal>n=2</literal> is system calls,
<literal>n=3</literal> is C library routines,
<literal>n=6</literal> is games, and
<literal>n=8</literal> (where present) is system administration
utilities.  Sections 4, 5, and 7 of the manuals have changed roles frequently
and in any case are not referred to in any of the entries.</para>

<para>Other etymology abbreviations such as <glossterm>Unix</glossterm> and
<glossterm>PDP-10</glossterm> refer to technical cultures surrounding specific
operating systems, processors, or other environments.  The fact that a term is
labelled with any one of these abbreviations does not necessarily mean its use
is confined to that culture.  In particular, many terms labelled
&lsquo;MIT&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stanford&rsquo; are in quite general use.  We
have tried to give some indication of the distribution of speakers in the
usage notes; however, a number of factors mentioned in the introduction
conspire to make these indications less definite than might be
desirable.</para>

   <para> Numeric zero, as opposed to the letter &lsquo;O&rsquo; (the 15th
   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they look a lot
   alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have
   compounded the confusion.  If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is
   not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an
   American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at
   a modern character display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated
   as an option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set
   descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype
   (Scandinavians, for whom &Oslash; is a letter, curse this arrangement).
   (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers; Florian Cajori's
   monumental <citetitle>A History of Mathematical Notations</citetitle> notes
   that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has
   a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very
   old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers
   (Scandinavians curse <emphasis>this</emphasis> arrangement even more,
   because it means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys
   equipment displays a zero with a <emphasis>reversed</emphasis> slash. Old
   CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken
   at upper right and lower left.  And yet another convention common on early
   line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the
   letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O
   (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII
   characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark
   in the upper-left corner).  Are we sufficiently confused yet?</para>

In Hall of Mists
You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to the west.
There are openings to either side. Nearby, a wide stone staircase leads
downward. The hall is filled with wisps of white mist swaying to and fro almost
as if alive. A cold wind blows up the staircase. There is a passage at the top
of a dome behind you.

Rough stone steps lead up the dome.

   <para> The archetypal individuals used as examples in discussions of
   cryptographic protocols.  Originally, theorists would say something like:
   <quote>A communicates with someone who claims to be B, So to be sure, A
   tests that B knows a secret number K. So A sends to B a random number X. B
   then forms Y by encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to A</quote>
   Because this sort of thing is quite hard to follow, theorists stopped using
   the unadorned letters A and B to represent the main players and started
   calling them Alice and Bob. So now we say <quote>Alice communicates with
   someone claiming to be Bob, and to be sure, Alice tests that Bob knows a
   secret number K. Alice sends to Bob a random number X. Bob then forms Y by
   encrypting X under key K and sends Y back to Alice</quote>.  A whole

   <para> A declaration of victory or superiority. The phrase stems from a
   1991 adaptation of Toaplan's <quote>Zero Wing</quote> shoot-'em-up arcade
   game for the Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to
   the opening screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst
   Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction
   shows the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS
   materializes and says, <quote>How are you gentlemen!!  All your base are
   belong to us.</quote> [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread
   virally through the Internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie
   of hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store front, package
   label, etc. hacked to read <quote>All your base are belong to us</quote> or
   one of the other many supremely dopey lines from the game (such as
   <quote>Somebody set up usthe bomb!!!</quote> or <quote>What
   happen?</quote>). When these phrases are used properly, the overall effect
   is both screamingly funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of the B movie
   <quote>They Live</quote>.</para>

   <para>The original has been generalized to <quote>All your X are belong to
   us</quote>, where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some
   sort.  Thus, <quote>When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he had
   to sign a draconian NDA. It basically said: All your code are belong to

   <para> A series of personal computer models originally sold by Commodore,
   based on 680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system
   that combined some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with
   compatibility with neither.</para>

   <para>The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
   standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious
   market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial
   technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small
   but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day
   unseating the clones (see <glossterm>Amiga Persecution Complex</glossterm>).
   The traits of this culture are both spoofed and
   illuminated in <ulink url='http://www.blazemonger.com/BM/'> The BLAZE Humor
   Viewer</ulink>. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small industry
   of companies building software and hardware for the platform, especially in
   graphics and video applications (see <glossterm>video toaster</glossterm>).
   </para>

   <para>Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&amp;D,
   allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead.  After
   Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several
   hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga is still being
   produced in Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans,
   which will probably extend the platform's life considerably.</para>

   Has been described as <quote>Moria on steroids</quote>; but, unlike Moria,
   many aspects of the game are customizable.  This leads many hackers and
   would-be hackers into fooling with these instead of doing productive work.
   There are many Angband variants, of which the most notorious is probably
   the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a key that does not
   correspond to a command is pressed, the game will display <quote>Type ? for
   help</quote> 50% of the time.  The other 50% of the time, random error
   messages including <quote>An error has occurred because an error of type 42
   has occurred</quote> and <quote>Windows 95 uninstalled successfully</quote>
   will be displayed.  Zangband also allows the player to kill Santa Claus
   (who has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends),
   <quote>Bull Gates</quote>, and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney
   has a nasty case of halitosis). There is an official angband home page at

   create for their environments so they can sell more boxes.  Hackers tend
   not to think of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker
   parlance the term excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging
   systems, though a user would consider all those to be apps.  (Broadly, an
   app is often a self-contained environment for performing some well-defined
   task such as &lsquo;word processing&rsquo;; hackers tend to prefer more
   general-purpose tools.) See <glossterm>killer app</glossterm>; oppose

   <para> [acronym, &lsquo;Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation&rsquo;] A
   Usenet <glossterm>cancelbot</glossterm> created by Dick Depew of Munroe
   Falls, Ohio.  ARMM was intended to automatically cancel posts from
   anonymous-posting sites.  Unfortunately, the robot's recognizer for
   anonymous postings triggered on its own automatically-generated control
   messages!  Transformed by this stroke of programming ineptitude into a
   monster of Frankensteinian proportions, it broke loose on the night of
   March 30, 1993 and proceeded to <glossterm>spam</glossterm> <systemitem
   role='newsgroup'>news.admin.policy</systemitem> with a recursive explosion
   of over 200 messages.</para>

   <para>ARMM's bug produced a recursive <glossterm>cascade</glossterm> of
   messages each of which mechanically added text to the ID and Subject and
   some other headers of its parent.  This produced a flood of messages in
   which each header took up several screens and each message ID and subject
   line got longer and longer and longer.</para>

   <para>Reactions varied from amusement to outrage.  The pathological
   messages crashed at least one mail system, and upset people paying line
   charges for their Usenet feeds.  One poster described the ARMM debacle as
   <quote>instant Usenet history</quote> (also establishing the term
   <glossterm>despew</glossterm>), and it has since been widely cited as a
   cautionary example of the havoc the combination of good intentions and
   incompetence can wreak on a network.  The Usenet thread on the subject is

   <para> [originally an acronym (American Standard Code for Information
   Interchange) but now merely conventional] The predominant character set
   encoding of present-day computers.  The standard version uses 7 bits for
   each character, whereas most earlier codes (including early drafts of ASCII
   prior to June 1961) used fewer.  This change allowed the inclusion of
   lowercase letters &mdash; a major <glossterm>win</glossterm> &mdash; but it
   did not provide for accented letters or any other letterforms not used in
   English (such as the German sharp-S &szlig;. or the ae-ligature &aelig;
   which is a letter in, for example, Norwegian).  It could be worse, though.
   It could be much worse.  See <glossterm>EBCDIC</glossterm> to understand
   how.  A history of ASCII and its ancestors is at <ulink
   url='http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html'>http://www.wps.com/texts/codes/index.html</ulink>.</para>

   <para>Computers are much pickier and less flexible about spelling than
   humans; thus, hackers need to be very precise when talking about
   characters, and have developed a considerable amount of verbal shorthand
   for them.  Every character has one or more names &mdash; some formal, some
   concise, some silly.  Common jargon names for ASCII characters are
   collected here.  See also individual entries for
   <glossterm>bang</glossterm>, <glossterm>excl</glossterm>,

   <glossterm>Yu-Shiang Whole Fish</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>This list derives from revision 2.3 of the Usenet ASCII pronunciation
   guide.  Single characters are listed in ASCII order; character pairs are
   sorted in by first member.  For each character, common names are given in
   rough order of popularity, followed by names that are reported but rarely
   seen; official ANSI/CCITT names are surrounded by brokets: &lt;&gt;.
   Square brackets mark the particularly silly names introduced by
   <glossterm>INTERCAL</glossterm>.  The abbreviations <quote>l/r</quote> and
   <quote>o/c</quote> stand for left/right and <quote>open/close</quote>
   respectively.  Ordinary parentheticals provide some usage

   sign&rsquo; (confusingly, on British keyboards the &pound; happens to
   replace <literal>#</literal>; thus Britishers sometimes call
   <literal>#</literal> on a U.S.-ASCII keyboard &lsquo;pound&rsquo;,
   compounding the American error).  The U.S. usage derives from an
   old-fashioned commercial practice of using a <literal>#</literal> suffix to
   tag pound weights on bills of lading.  The character is usually pronounced
   &lsquo;hash&rsquo; outside the U.S.  There are more culture wars over the
   correct pronunciation of this character than any other, which has led to
   the <glossterm>ha ha only serious</glossterm> suggestion that it be
   pronounced <quote>shibboleth</quote> (see Judges 12:6 in an Old Testament or
   Tanakh).</para>

   <para>The &lsquo;uparrow&rsquo; name for circumflex and
   &lsquo;leftarrow&rsquo; name for underline are historical relics from
   archaic ASCII (the 1963 version), which had these graphics in those
   character positions rather than the modern punctuation characters.</para>

   <para>The &lsquo;swung dash&rsquo; or &lsquo;approximation&rsquo; sign
   (&sim;) is not quite the same as tilde ~ in typeset material, but the ASCII
   tilde serves for both (compare <glossterm>angle brackets</glossterm>).
   </para>

   <para>Some other common usages cause odd overlaps.  The
   <literal>#</literal>, <literal>$</literal>, <literal>&gt;</literal>, and
   <literal>&amp;</literal> characters, for example, are all pronounced
   <quote>hex</quote> in different communities because various assemblers use
   them as a prefix tag for hexadecimal constants (in particular,
   <literal>#</literal> in many assembler-programming cultures,
   <literal>$</literal> in the 6502 world, <literal>&gt;</literal> at Texas
   Instruments, and <literal>&amp;</literal> on the BBC Micro, Sinclair, and
   some Z80 machines).  See also <glossterm>splat</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>The inability of ASCII text to correctly represent any of the world's
   other major languages makes the designers' choice of 7 bits look more and
   more like a serious <glossterm>misfeature</glossterm> as the use of
   international networks continues to increase (see 
   <glossterm>software rot</glossterm>).
   Hardware and software from the U.S. still tends to
   embody the assumption that ASCII is the universal character set and that
   characters have 7 bits; this is a major irritant to people who want to use
   a character set suited to their own languages.  Perversely, though, efforts
   to solve this problem by proliferating &lsquo;national&rsquo; character
   sets produce an evolutionary pressure to use a <emphasis>smaller</emphasis>
   subset common to all those in use.</para>

   <para> [common] A hole in the security of a system deliberately left in
   place by designers or maintainers.  The motivation for such holes is not
   always sinister; some operating systems, for example, come out of the box
   with privileged accounts intended for use by field service technicians or
   the vendor's maintenance programmers.  Syn.  
   <glossterm>trap door</glossterm>; may also be called a <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>wormhole</emphasis>.  See also 
   <glossterm>iron box</glossterm>, <glossterm>cracker</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>worm</glossterm>, <glossterm>logic bomb</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Historically, back doors have often lurked in systems longer than
   anyone expected or planned, and a few have become widely known.  Ken
   Thompson's 1983 Turing Award lecture to the ACM admitted the existence of a
   back door in early Unix versions that may have qualified as the most
   fiendishly clever security hack of all time.  In this scheme, the C
   compiler contained code that would recognize when the <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>login</emphasis> command was being recompiled and insert
   some code recognizing a password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to
   the system whether or not an account had been created for him.</para>

   <para>Normally such a back door could be removed by removing it from the
   source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler.  But to
   recompile the compiler, you have to <emphasis>use</emphasis> the compiler
   &mdash; so Thompson also arranged that the compiler would
   <emphasis>recognize when it was compiling a version of itself</emphasis>,
   and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the
   recompiled <emphasis role='firstterm'>login</emphasis> the code to allow
   Thompson entry &mdash; and, of course, the code to recognize itself and do
   the whole thing again the next time around!  And having done this once, he
   was then able to recompile the compiler from the original sources; the hack
   perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place and active but
   with no trace in the sources.</para>

   <para>The Turing lecture that reported this truly moby hack was later
   published as <quote>Reflections on Trusting Trust</quote>,
   <citetitle>Communications of the ACM 27</citetitle>, 8 (August 1984),
   pp. 761--763 (text available at <ulink
   url='http://www.acm.org/classics/sep95/'>http://www.acm.org/classics/</ulink>).
   Ken Thompson has since confirmed that this hack was implemented and that
   the Trojan Horse code did appear in the login binary of a Unix Support
   group machine.  Ken says the crocked compiler was never distributed.  Your
   editor has heard two separate reports that suggest that the crocked login
   did make it out of Bell Labs, notably to BBN, and that it enabled at least
   one late-night login across the network by someone using the login name

   <para> A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the
   <glossterm>Great Renaming</glossterm> and reined in the chaos of
   <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm> during most of the 1980s.  During most of its
   lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied
   its own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to their
   secrets to respond <quote>There is no Cabal</quote> whenever the existence
   or activities of the group were speculated on in public.</para>

   <para>The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery.  Even a
   decade after the cabal <glossterm>mailing list</glossterm> disbanded in
   late 1988 following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or
   claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only gone deeper
   underground with its power intact.</para>

   <para>This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about
   various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over
   the Usenet or Internet.  These paranoias were later satirized in ways that
   took on a life of their own.  See <glossterm>Eric Conspiracy</glossterm>
   for one example.  Part of the background for this kind of humor is that
   many hackers cultivate a fondness for conspiracy theory considered as a
   kind of surrealist art; see the bibliography entry on
   <citetitle>Illuminatus!</citetitle> for the novel that launched this
   trend.</para>

   <para> [Georgia Tech] A <quote>baggy pantsing</quote> is used to reprimand
   hackers who incautiously leave their terminals unlocked.  The affected user
   will come back to find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing
   exactly how baggy their pants are, an accepted stand-in for
   <quote>unattentive user who left their work unprotected in the
   clusters</quote>. A properly-done baggy pantsing is highly mocking and
   humorous.  It is considered bad form to post a baggy pantsing to off-campus
   newsgroups or the more technical, serious groups.  A particularly nice
   baggy pantsing may be <quote>claimed</quote> by immediately quoting the
   message in full, followed by your <glossterm>sig block</glossterm>; this
   has the added benefit of keeping the embarassed victim from being able to
   delete the post.  Interesting baggy-pantsings have been done involving
   adding commands to login scripts to repost the message every time the
   unlucky user logs in; Unix boxes on the residential network, when cracked,
   oftentimes have their homepages replaced (after being politely backed-up to
   another file) with a baggy-pants message; .plan files are also occasionally
   targeted. Usage: <quote>Prof. Greenlee fell asleep in the Solaris cluster
   again; we baggy-pantsed him to <systemitem

   not uncommon.  Late-night dial-up UUCP links would cause week-long
   transmission times.  Bang paths were often selected by both transmission
   time and reliability, as messages would not infrequently get lost.  See

   <para> A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's

   observed in <citetitle>Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal

   good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC:

   write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily;
   writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits
   that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.  This
   wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on
   low-end micros in the 1980s.  As it is, it probably ruined tens of

   <para> In 1997, after meditating on the success of
   <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> for three years, the Jargon File's own editor
   ESR wrote an analytical paper on hacker culture and development models
   titled <ulink url='&esrhome;/writings/cathedral-bazaar/'>
   The Cathedral and the Bazaar</ulink>.  The main argument of the paper was
   that <glossterm>Brooks's Law</glossterm> is not the whole story; given the
   right social machinery, debugging can be efficiently parallelized across
   large numbers of programmers.  The title metaphor caught on (see also
   <glossterm>cathedral</glossterm>), and the style of development typical in
   the Linux community is now often referred to as the bazaar mode.  Its
   characteristics include releasing code early and often, and actively
   seeking the largest possible pool of peer reviewers. After 1998, the
   evident success of this way of doing things became one of the strongest
   arguments for <glossterm>open source</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> [common; abbreviation, <quote>Bulletin Board System</quote>] An
   electronic bulletin board system; that is, a message database where people
   can log in and leave broadcast messages for others grouped (typically) into
   <glossterm>topic group</glossterm>s.  The term was especially applied to
   the thousands of local BBS systems that operated during the pre-Internet
   microcomputer era of roughly 1980 to 1995, typically run by amateurs for
   fun out of their homes on MS-DOS boxes with a single modem line each.  Fans
   of Usenet and Internet or the big commercial timesharing bboards such as
   CompuServe and GEnie tended to consider local BBSes the low-rent district
   of the hacker culture, but they served a valuable function by knitting
   together lots of hackers and users in the personal-micro world who would
   otherwise have been unable to exchange code at all.  Post-Internet, BBSs
   are likely to be local newsgroups on an ISP; efficiency has increased but a
   certain flavor has been lost.  See also

   <para> [abbreviation, <quote>Basic Combined Programming Language</quote>) A
   programming language developed by Martin Richards in Cambridge in 1967. It
   is remarkable for its rich syntax, small size of compiler (it can be run in
   16k) and extreme portability. It reached break-even point at a very early
   stage, and was the language in which the original <glossterm>hello
   world</glossterm> program was written. It has been ported to so many
   different systems that its creator confesses to having lost count. It has
   only one data type (a machine word) which can be used as an integer, a
   character, a floating point number, a pointer, or almost anything else,
   depending on context.  BCPL was a precursor of C, which inherited some of
   its features.</para>

   demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.  The
   C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early
   samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated

   <para> 1. Describes a computer architecture in which, within a given
   multi-byte numeric representation, the most significant byte has the lowest
   address (the word is stored &lsquo;big-end-first&rsquo;).  Most processors,
   including the IBM 370 family, the <glossterm>PDP-10</glossterm>, the
   Motorola microprocessor families, and most of the various RISC designs are
   big-endian.  Big-endian byte order is also sometimes called <emphasis

   <para> 2. An Internet address the wrong way round.  Most of the world
   follows the Internet standard and writes email addresses starting with the
   name of the computer and ending up with the name of the country.  In the
   U.K.: the Joint Academic Networking Team had decided to do it the other way
   round before the Internet domain standard was established.  Most gateway
   sites have <glossterm>ad-hockery</glossterm> in their mailers to handle
   this, but can still be confused.  In particular, the address <systemitem
   role='hostname'>me@uk.ac.bris.pys.as</systemitem> could be interpreted in
   JANET's big-endian way as one in the U.K. (domain <systemitem
   role='hostname'>uk</systemitem>) or in the standard little-endian way as
   one in the domain <systemitem role='hostname'>as</systemitem> (American
   Samoa) on the opposite side of the world.</para>

   <para>Sense 1 may require some explanation.  Most computer languages
   provide a kind of data called <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>integer</emphasis>, but such computer integers are usually
   very limited in size; usually they must be smaller than
   <literal>2<superscript>31</superscript></literal> (2,147,483,648).  If you
   want to work with numbers larger than that, you have to use floating-point
   numbers, which are usually accurate to only six or seven decimal places.
   Computer languages that provide bignums can perform exact calculations on
   very large numbers, such as 1000! (the factorial of 1000, which is 1000
   times 999 times 998 times &ellipsis; times 2 times 1).  For example, this
   value for 1000!  was computed by the MacLISP system using bignums:</para>

   <para> Transmission of data on a serial line, when accomplished by rapidly
   tweaking a single output bit, in software, at the appropriate times.  The
   technique is a simple loop with eight OUT and SHIFT instruction pairs for
   each byte.  Input is more interesting.  And full duplex (doing input and
   output at the same time) is one way to separate the real hackers from the

   <para>Bit bang was used on certain early models of Prime computers,
   presumably when UARTs were too expensive, and on archaic Z80 micros with a
   Zilog PIO but no SIO.  In an interesting instance of the <glossterm>cycle
   of reincarnation</glossterm>, this technique returned to use in the early
   1990s on some RISC architectures because it consumes such an infinitesimal
   part of the processor that it actually makes sense not to have a UART.

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>This term is used purely in jest.  It is based on the fanciful notion
   that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced.  This
   appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term &lsquo;bit box&rsquo;,
   about which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that
   trainees used to be told that when the CPU stored bits into memory it was
   actually pulling them <quote>out of the bit box</quote>.  See also 
   <glossterm>chad box</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
   <quote>parity preservation law</quote>, the number of 1 bits that go to the
   bit bucket must equal the number of 0 bits.  Any imbalance results in bits
   filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician can empty a
   full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.</para>

   <para>The source for all these meanings, is, historically, the fact that
   the <glossterm>chad box</glossterm> on a paper-tape punch was sometimes
   called a bit bucket.</para>

   error-detecting circuitry to compensate for them).  The notion long favored

<glossdef>
   <para> (alt.: <emphasis role='firstterm'>bit-shift keyboard</emphasis>) A
   non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the
   Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several years on early computer
   equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see
   <glossterm>EOU</glossterm>), so the only way to generate the character
   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the
   ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified
   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In order to
   avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design
   had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one
   key.</para>

   <para>Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:</para>

<screen remap='smallexample'>
high  low bits
bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
 010        !    &quot;    #    $    %    &amp;    '    (    )
 011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
</screen>

   <para>This is why the characters !"#$%&amp;'() appear where they do on a
   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype
   Model 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally
   intended to use a code that contained these two rows:</para>

<screen remap='smallexample'>
      low bits
high  0000  0010  0100  0110  1000  1010  1100  1110
bits     0001  0011  0101  0111  1001  1011  1101  1111
  10   )  ! bel #  $  % wru &amp;  *  (  &quot;  :  ?  _  ,   .
  11   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  '  ;  /  - esc del
</screen>

   <para>The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard.
   But as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep
   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:</para>

<screen remap='smallexample'>
          !  "  ?  $  '  &amp;  -  (  )  ;  :  *  /  ,  .
       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  +  ~  &lt;  &gt;  &times;  |
</screen>

   <para>Teletype's was <emphasis>not</emphasis> the weirdest variant of the
   <glossterm>QWERTY</glossterm> layout widely seen, by the way; that prize
   should probably go to one of several (differing) arrangements on IBM's even
   clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.</para>

   <para>When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.
   Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used the
   flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like an
   office typewriter.  Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer
   keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as
   <quote>logical bit pairing</quote> and <quote>typewriter
   pairing</quote>. These alternatives became known as <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>bit-paired</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>typewriter-paired</emphasis> keyboards.  To a hacker, the
   bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical &mdash; and because most
   hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little
   pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter
   standard.</para>

   <para>The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction
   of the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where
   out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment.  The <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>typewriter-paired</emphasis> standard became universal,
   X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>bit-paired</emphasis> hardware was quickly junked or
   relegated to dusty corners, and both terms passed into disuse.</para>
<!-- from Joe Morris <jcmorris@mwunix.mitre.org>, 04 Jan 1991 (in alt.folklore.computers) -->

   <para>However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
   argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As
   a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen
   etc. still has all of the !&quot;#$%&amp;'() characters above the numbers in the
   ASR-33 layout.</para>

   <para>Old-time hackers sometimes get nostalgic for blinkenlights because
   they were so much more fun to look at than a blank panel.  Sadly, very few
   computers still have them (the three LEDs on a PC keyboard certainly don't
   count). The obvious reasons (cost of wiring, cost of front-panel cutouts,
   almost nobody needs or wants to interpret machine-register states on the
   fly anymore) are only part of the story.  Another part of it is that
   radio-frequency leakage from the lamp wiring was beginning to be a problem
   as far back as transistor machines.  But the most fundamental fact is that
   there are very few signals slow enough to blink an LED these days!  With
   slow CPUs, you could watch the bus register or instruction counter tick,
   but even at 33/66/150MHz (let alone gigahertz speeds) it's all a
   blur.</para>
<!-- from Jeff Jonas <jeffj@panix.com>, 06 Jan 1994 -->

   <para>Despite this, a couple of relatively recent computer designs of note
   have featured programmable blinkenlights that were added just because they
   looked cool.  The Connection Machine, a 65,536-processor parallel computer
   designed in the mid-1980s, was a black cube with one side covered with a
   grid of red blinkenlights; the sales demo had them evolving
   <glossterm>life</glossterm> patterns.  A few years later the ill-fated
   BeBox (a personal computer designed to run the BeOS operating system)
   featured twin rows of blinkenlights on the case front. When Be,
   Inc. decided to get out of the hardware business in 1996 and instead ported
   their OS to the PowerPC and later to the Intel architecture, many users
   suffered severely from the absence of their beloved blinkenlights.  Before
   long an external version of the blinkenlights driven by a PC serial port
   became available; there is some sort of plot symmetry in the fact that it
   was assembled by a German.</para>

   <para>This newest version partly reflects reports that the word
   &lsquo;blinkenlights&rsquo; is (in 1999) undergoing something of a revival
   in usage, but applied to networking equipment. The transmit and receive
   lights on routers, activity lights on switches and hubs, and other network
   equipment often blink in visually pleasing and seemingly coordinated
   ways. Although this is different in some ways from register readings, a
   tall stack of Cisco equipment or a 19-inch rack of ISDN terminals can
   provoke a similar feeling of hypnotic awe, especially in a darkened network
   operations center or server room.</para>

   are recorded in this lexicon for flavor.  Bloggers often divide themselves

   and technology policy, while the warbloggers are more politically focused
   and tend to be preoccupied with U.S. and world response to the post-9/11
   war against terrorism.  The overlap with hackerdom is heaviest among the
   techbloggers, but several of the most prominent warbloggers are also
   hackers.  Bloggers in general tend to be aware of and sympathetic to the

   <para> 1. [techspeak] Acronym for <emphasis role='firstterm'>Backus Normal
   Form</emphasis> (later retronymed to <emphasis role='firstterm'>Backus-Naur
   Form</emphasis> because BNF was not in fact a normal form), a metasyntactic
   notation used to specify the syntax of programming languages, command sets,
   and the like.  Widely used for language descriptions but seldom documented
   anywhere, so that it must usually be learned by osmosis from other hackers.
   Consider this BNF for a U.S. postal address:</para>

<literallayout remap='smallexample'>
 &lt;postal-address&gt; ::= &lt;name-part&gt; &lt;street-address&gt; &lt;zip-part&gt;

 &lt;personal-part&gt; ::= &lt;name&gt; | &lt;initial&gt; "."

 &lt;name-part&gt; ::= &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;last-name&gt; [&lt;jr-part&gt;] &lt;EOL&gt;
               | &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;name-part&gt;

 &lt;street-address&gt; ::= [&lt;apt&gt;] &lt;house-num&gt; &lt;street-name&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;

 &lt;zip-part&gt; ::= &lt;town-name&gt; "," &lt;state-code&gt; &lt;ZIP-code&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;
</literallayout>

   <para>This translates into English as: <quote>A postal-address consists of
   a name-part, followed by a street-address part, followed by a zip-code
   part.  A personal-part consists of either a first name or an initial
   followed by a dot.  A name-part consists of either: a personal-part
   followed by a last name followed by an optional jr-part (Jr., Sr., or
   dynastic number) and end-of-line, or a personal part followed by a name
   part (this rule illustrates the use of recursion in BNFs, covering the case
   of people who use multiple first and middle names and/or initials).  A
   street address consists of an optional apartment specifier, followed by a
   street number, followed by a street name.  A zip-part consists of a
   town-name, followed by a comma, followed by a state code, followed by a
   ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line.</quote> Note that many things (such as
   the format of a personal-part, apartment specifier, or ZIP-code) are left
   unspecified.  These are presumed to be obvious from context or detailed
   somewhere nearby.  See also <glossterm>parse</glossterm>.</para>

   possibly containing some or all of the <glossterm>regexp</glossterm>
   wildcards such as <command remap='code'>*</command> or <command

   invented for the Algol-60 report; it uses <command

   <para> At <ulink url='http://www.demon.net/'> Demon Internet</ulink>, all
   tech support personnel are called <quote>Bob</quote>.  (Female support
   personnel have an option on <quote>Bobette</quote>).  This has nothing to
   do with Bob the divine drilling-equipment salesman of the 
   <glossterm>Church of the SubGenius</glossterm>.  Nor is it acronymized from <quote>Brother Of
   <glossterm>BOFH</glossterm></quote>, though all parties agree it could have
   been.  Rather, it was triggered by an unusually large draft of new
   tech-support people in 1995.  It was observed that there would be much
   duplication of names.  To ease the confusion, it was decided that all
   support techs would henceforth be known as <quote>Bob</quote>, and identity
   badges were created labelled <quote>Bob 1</quote> and <quote>Bob 2</quote>.
   (<quote>No, we never got any further</quote> reports a witness).</para>

   <para>The reason for <quote>Bob</quote> rather than anything else is due to
   a <glossterm>luser</glossterm> calling and asking to speak to
   <quote>Bob</quote>, despite the fact that no <quote>Bob</quote> was
   currently working for Tech Support.  Since we all know <quote>the customer
   is always right</quote>, it was decided that there had to be at least one
   <quote>Bob</quote> on duty at all times, just in case.</para>

   <para>This sillyness snowballed inexorably.  Shift leaders and managers
   began to refer to their groups of <quote>bobs</quote>.  Whole ranks of
   support machines were set up (and still exist in the DNS as of 1999) as
   bob1 through bobN. Then came <systemitem
   role='newsgroup'>alt.tech-support.recovery</systemitem>, and it was filled
   with Demon support personnel.  They all referred to themselves, and to
   others, as <quote>bob</quote>, and after a while it caught on.  There is

   <para>A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the
   interesting property that, if the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
   mechanics is true, it can sort an arbitrarily large array in linear time.
   (In the Many-Worlds model, the result of any quantum action is to split the
   universe-before into a sheaf of universes-after, one for each possible way
   the state vector can collapse; in any one of the universes-after the result
   appears random.)  The steps are: 1. Permute the array randomly using a
   quantum process, 2. If the array is not sorted, destroy the universe
   (checking that the list is sorted requires O(n) time).  Implementation of
   step 2 is left as an exercise for the reader.</para>

   <para>Astrology is bogus.  So is a bolt that is obviously about to break.
   So is someone who makes blatantly false claims to have solved a scientific
   problem.  (This word seems to have some, but not all, of the connotations
   of <glossterm>random</glossterm> &mdash; mostly the negative ones.)</para>

   <para>It is claimed that <emphasis role='firstterm'>bogus</emphasis> was
   originally used in the hackish sense at Princeton in the late 1960s.  It
   was spread to CMU and Yale by Michael Shamos, a migratory Princeton
   alumnus.  A glossary of bogus words was compiled at Yale when the word was
   first popularized there about 1975-76.  These coinages spread into
   hackerdom from CMU and MIT.  Most of them remained wordplay objects rather
   than actual vocabulary items or live metaphors.  Examples: <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>amboguous</emphasis> (having multiple bogus
   interpretations); <emphasis role='firstterm'>bogotissimo</emphasis> (in a
   gloriously bogus manner); <emphasis role='firstterm'>bogotophile</emphasis>
   (one who is pathologically fascinated by the bogus); <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>paleobogology</emphasis> (the study of primeval
   bogosity).</para>

   <para>Some bogowords, however, obtained sufficient live currency to be
   listed elsewhere in this lexicon; see <glossterm>bogometer</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>bogon</glossterm>, <glossterm>bogotify</glossterm>, and
   <glossterm>quantum bogodynamics</glossterm> and the related but unlisted
   <glossterm>Dr. Fred Mbogo</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>By the early 1980s &lsquo;bogus&rsquo; was also current in something
   like hacker usage sense in West Coast teen slang, and it had gone
   mainstream by 1985.  A correspondent from Cambridge reports, by contrast,
   that these uses of <emphasis role='firstterm'>bogus</emphasis> grate on
   British nerves; in Britain the word means, rather specifically,
   &lsquo;counterfeit&rsquo;, as in <quote>a bogus 10-pound note</quote>.
   According to Merriam-Webster, the word dates back to 1825 and originally
   referred to a counterfeiting machine.</para>

   <para> [techspeak; from &lsquo;by one's bootstraps&rsquo;] To load and
   initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage is no longer
   jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given rise to some
   derivatives that are still jargon.</para>

   <para>The derivative <emphasis role='firstterm'>reboot</emphasis> implies
   that the machine hasn't been down for long, or that the boot is a
   <glossterm>bounce</glossterm> (sense 4) intended to clear some state of
   <glossterm>wedgitude</glossterm>.  This is sometimes used of human thought
   processes, as in the following exchange: <quote>You've lost me.</quote>
   <quote>OK, reboot.  Here's the theory&endellipsis;</quote></para>

   <para>This term is also found in the variants <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>cold boot</emphasis> (from power-off condition) and
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>warm boot</emphasis> (with the CPU and all
   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software
   crash).</para>

   <para>Another variant: <emphasis role='firstterm'>soft boot</emphasis>,
   reinitialization of only part of a system, under control of other software
   still running: <quote>If you're running the <glossterm>mess-dos</glossterm>
   emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while
   leaving the rest of the system running.</quote></para>

   <para>Opposed to this there is <emphasis role='firstterm'>hard
   boot</emphasis>, which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the
   machine being booted: <quote>I'll have to hard-boot this losing
   Sun.</quote> <quote>I recommend booting it hard.</quote> One often
   hard-boots by performing a <glossterm>power cycle</glossterm>.</para>
</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historical note: this term derives from <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>bootstrap loader</emphasis>, a short program that was read
   in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front panel switches.
   This program was always very short (great efforts were expended on making
   it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of error involved in
   toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more
   complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive.
   Thus, in successive steps, the computer &lsquo;pulled itself up by its
   bootstraps&rsquo; to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the bootstrap is
   usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed
   location on the disk, called the &lsquo;boot block&rsquo;.  When this
   program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and hand
   control over to it.</para>

   <para> Hackish opposite of the techspeak term <emphasis

   exploratory designs that cannot be closely specified in advance) that it
   works best to <emphasis>build</emphasis> things in the opposite order, by
   writing and testing a clean set of primitive operations and then knitting
   them together.  Naively applied, this leads to hacked-together bottom-up

   code within primitives at the mid-level of the system is gradually replaced

   <para> A measurement of the severity of spam invented by long-time hacker
   Seth Breidbart, used for programming cancelbots. The Breidbart Index takes
   into account the fact that excessive multi-posting
   <glossterm>EMP</glossterm> is worse than excessive cross-posting
   <glossterm>ECP</glossterm>.  The Breidbart Index is computed as follows:
   For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the number of
   newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart Index is the sum
   of the square roots of all of the posts in the spam. For example, one
   article posted to nine newsgroups and again to sixteen would have BI =
   sqrt(9) + sqrt(16) = 7.  It is generally agreed that a spam is cancelable
   if the Breidbart Index exceeds 20.</para>

   <para>The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles
   yesterday and ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up to a
   30-article spam. Spam fighters will often reset the count if you can
   convince them that the spam was accidental and/or you have seen the error
   of your ways and won't repeat it.  Breidbart Index can accumulate over
   multiple authors. For example, the <quote>Make Money Fast</quote> pyramid
   scheme exceeded a BI of 20 a long time ago, and is now considered
   <quote>cancel on sight</quote>.</para>

   <para> Describes a primitive programming style, one in which the programmer
   relies on the computer's processing power instead of using his or her own
   intelligence to simplify the problem, often ignoring problems of scale and
   applying naive methods suited to small problems directly to large ones.
   The term can also be used in reference to programming style: brute-force
   programs are written in a heavyhanded, tedious way, full of repetition and
   devoid of any elegance or useful abstraction (see also 
   <glossterm>brute force and ignorance</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>The <glossterm>canonical</glossterm> example of a brute-force
   algorithm is associated with the &lsquo;traveling salesman problem&rsquo;
   (TSP), a classical <glossterm>NP-</glossterm>hard problem: Suppose a person
   is in, say, Boston, and wishes to drive to <literal>N</literal> other
   cities.  In what order should the cities be visited in order to minimize
   the distance travelled?  The brute-force method is to simply generate all
   possible routes and compare the distances; while guaranteed to work and
   simple to implement, this algorithm is clearly very stupid in that it
   considers even obviously absurd routes (like going from Boston to Houston
   via San Francisco and New York, in that order).  For very small
   <literal>N</literal> it works well, but it rapidly becomes absurdly
   inefficient when <literal>N</literal> increases (for <literal>N =
   15</literal>, there are already 1,307,674,368,000 possible routes to
   consider, and for <literal>N = 1000</literal> &mdash; well, see
   <glossterm>bignum</glossterm>).  Sometimes, unfortunately, there is no
   better general solution than brute force.  See also
   <glossterm>NP-</glossterm> and <glossterm>rubber-hose
   cryptanalysis</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>A more simple-minded example of brute-force programming is finding
   the smallest number in a large list by first using an existing program to
   sort the list in ascending order, and then picking the first number off the
   front.</para>

   <para>Whether brute-force programming should actually be considered stupid
   or not depends on the context; if the problem is not terribly big, the
   extra CPU time spent on a brute-force solution may cost less than the
   programmer time it would take to develop a more &lsquo;intelligent&rsquo;
   algorithm.  Additionally, a more intelligent algorithm may imply more
   long-term complexity cost and bug-chasing than are justified by the speed
   improvement.</para>

   <para>Ken Thompson, co-inventor of Unix, is reported to have uttered the
   epigram <quote>When in doubt, use brute force</quote>.  He probably
   intended this as a <glossterm>ha ha only serious</glossterm>, but the
   original Unix kernel's preference for simple, robust, and portable
   algorithms over <glossterm>brittle</glossterm> &lsquo;smart&rsquo; ones
   does seem to have been a significant factor in the success of that OS.
   Like so many other tradeoffs in software design, the choice between brute
   force and complex, finely-tuned cleverness is often a difficult one that
   requires both engineering savvy and delicate esthetic judgment.</para>

   <para>It has long been rumored that <emphasis role='firstterm'>bucky
   bits</emphasis> were named for Buckminster Fuller during a period when he
   was consulting at Stanford.  Actually, bucky bits were invented by Niklaus
   Wirth when <emphasis>he</emphasis> was at Stanford in 1964--65; he first
   suggested the idea of an EDIT key to set the 8th bit of an otherwise 7-bit
   ASCII character).  It seems that, unknown to Wirth, certain Stanford
   hackers had privately nicknamed him &lsquo;Bucky&rsquo; after a prominent
   portion of his dental anatomy, and this nickname transferred to the bit.
   Bucky-bit commands were used in a number of editors written at Stanford,
   including most notably TV-EDIT and NLS.</para>

   <para>The term spread to MIT and CMU early and is now in general use.
   Ironically, Wirth himself remained unaware of its derivation for nearly 30
   years, until GLS dug up this history in early 1993!  See

   <para> What happens when you try to stuff more data into a buffer (holding
   area) than it can handle.  This problem is commonly exploited by
   <glossterm>cracker</glossterm>s to get arbitrary commands executed by a
   program running with root permissions.  This may be due to a mismatch in
   the processing rates of the producing and consuming processes (see
   <glossterm>overrun</glossterm> and 
   <glossterm>firehose syndrome</glossterm>), or because the buffer is simply too small to hold
   all the data that must accumulate before a piece of it can be processed.
   For example, in a text-processing tool that <glossterm>crunch</glossterm>es
   a line at a time, a short line buffer can result in
   <glossterm>lossage</glossterm> as input from a long line overflows the
   buffer and trashes data beyond it.  Good defensive programming would check
   for overflow on each character and stop accepting data when the buffer is
   full up.  The term is used of and by humans in a metaphorical sense.

   <para>Historical note: Admiral Grace Hopper (an early computing pioneer
   better known for inventing <glossterm>COBOL</glossterm>) liked to tell a
   story in which a technician solved a <glossterm>glitch</glossterm> in the
   Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the
   contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated
   <glossterm>bug</glossterm> in its hackish sense as a joke about the
   incident (though, as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it
   happened).  For many years the logbook associated with the incident and the
   actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and
   the moth taped into it, is recorded in the <citetitle>Annals of the History
   of Computing</citetitle>, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285--286.</para>

   <para>The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads <quote>1545
   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
   found</quote>.  This wording establishes that the term was already in use
   at the time in its current specific sense &mdash; and Hopper herself
   reports that the term <emphasis role='firstterm'>bug</emphasis> was
   regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII.</para>

       <para>The &lsquo;original bug&rsquo; (the caption date is incorrect)</para>
     </caption>
   </mediaobject>

   <para>Indeed, the use of <emphasis role='firstterm'>bug</emphasis> to mean
   an industrial defect was already established in Thomas Edison's time, and a
   more specific and rather modern use can be found in an electrical handbook
   from 1896 (<citetitle>Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity</citetitle>,
   Theo. Audel &amp; Co.)  which says: <quote>The term &lsquo;bug&rsquo; is
   used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the
   connections or working of electric apparatus.</quote> It further notes that
   the term is <quote>said to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and
   have been transferred to all electric apparatus.</quote></para>

   <para>The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which <quote>bugs in a
   telephone cable</quote> were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a
   joke first current among <emphasis>telegraph</emphasis> operators more than
   a century ago!</para>

   <para>Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
   term <quote>bug</quote> was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy
   to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a
   string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which
   were among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on
   them (and still do)!  While the ability to send repeated dots automatically
   was very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also
   significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could
   take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the
   code by holding the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands of an
   inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex <quote>bug</quote> on the line could
   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.</para>

   <para>Further, the term <quote>bug</quote> has long been used among radio
   technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic field
   variations into acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference
   and look for dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from
   the roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists.
   The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two
   wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap
   (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope
   is to the stereotypical medical doctor.  This sense is almost certainly
   ancestral to modern use of <quote>bug</quote> for a covert monitoring
   device, but may also have contributed to the use of <quote>bug</quote> for
   the effects of radio interference itself.</para>

   <para>Actually, use of <emphasis role='firstterm'>bug</emphasis> in the
   general sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI,
   part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward: <quote>So, lie thou there. Die
   thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.</quote>)
   In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>bug</emphasis> is <quote>A frightful object; a
   walking spectre</quote>; this is traced to &lsquo;bugbear&rsquo;, a Welsh
   term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle)
   has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy
   role-playing games.</para>

   <para>In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.  Here
   is a plausible conversation that never actually happened: <quote>There is a
   bug in this ant farm!</quote> <quote>What do you mean?  I don't see any
   ants in it.</quote> <quote>That's the bug.</quote></para>

   <para>[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to
   the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted.  A
   correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not there.
   While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered that the NSWC
   still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to
   accept it &mdash; and that the present curator of their History of American
   Technology Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a
   worthwhile exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due
   to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years
   afterwards.  Thus, the process of investigating the original-computer-bug
   bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true!

   <para>Technically, <emphasis role='firstterm'>busy-wait</emphasis> means to
   wait on an event by <glossterm>spin</glossterm>ning through a tight or
   timed-delay loop that polls for the event on each pass, as opposed to
   setting up an interrupt handler and continuing execution on another part of
   the task.  In applications this is a wasteful technique, and best avoided
   on timesharing systems where a busy-waiting program may
   <glossterm>hog</glossterm> the processor.  However, it is often unavoidable
   in kernel programming.  In the Linux world, kernel busy-waits are usually
   referred to as <emphasis role='firstterm'>spinlocks</emphasis>.</para>

   <para> [techspeak] A unit of memory or data equal to the amount used to
   represent one character; on modern architectures this is invariably 8 bits.
   Some older architectures used <emphasis role='firstterm'>byte</emphasis>
   for quantities of 6, 7, or (especially) 9 bits, and the PDP-10 supported
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>bytes</emphasis> that were actually bitfields of

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historical note: The term was coined by Werner Buchholz in 1956
   during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer; originally it
   was described as 1 to 6 bits (typical I/O equipment of the period used
   6-bit chunks of information).  The move to an 8-bit byte happened in late
   1956, and this size was later adopted and promulgated as a standard by the
   System/360.  The word was coined by mutating the word &lsquo;bite&rsquo; so
   it would not be accidentally misspelled as <glossterm>bit</glossterm>.  See

   <para> The tendency of the undisciplined C programmer to set arbitrary but

   by constants in header files) rather than taking the trouble to do proper
   dynamic storage allocation.  If an application user later needs to put 68
   elements into a table of size 50, the afflicted programmer reasons that he
   or she can easily reset the table size to 68 (or even as much as 70, to
   allow for future expansion) and recompile.  This gives the programmer the
   comfortable feeling of having made the effort to satisfy the user's
   (unreasonable) demands, and often affords the user multiple opportunities
   to explore the marvelous consequences of 
   <glossterm>fandango on core</glossterm>.  In severe cases of the disease, the programmer cannot
   comprehend why each fix of this kind seems only to further disgruntle the

   <para>A variable in a programming language is sait to be camelCased when
   all words but the first are capitalized.  This practice contrasts with the
   C tradition of either running syllables together or marking syllable breaks
   with underscores; thus, where a C programmer would write
   <symbol>thisverylongname</symbol> or <symbol>this_very_long_name</symbol>,
   the camelCased version would be <symbol>thisVeryLongName</symbol>. This
   practice is common in certain language communities (formerly Pascal; today
   Java and Visual Basic) and tends to be associated with object-oriented
   programming.</para>

   <para>Compare <glossterm>BiCapitalization</glossterm>; but where that

   <para> The traditional program comment for code executed under a condition

   Often, such a condition being true indicates data corruption or a faulty

   and terminating or crashing, since there is little else that can be done.
   Some case variant of <quote>can't happen</quote> is also often the text
   emitted if the &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; error actually happens!  Although
   <quote>can't happen</quote> events are genuinely infrequent in production
   code, programmers wise enough to check for them habitually are often

   <para> A programming-language grammar that is mostly <glossterm>syntactic

   <glossterm>COBOL</glossterm>, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot of the
   so-called &lsquo;4GL&rsquo; database languages share this property.  The
   usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as possible,
   on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled people to
   program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn't
   what makes programming hard; it's the mental effort and organization
   required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs.  Thus the invariable
   result is that &lsquo;candygrammar&rsquo; languages are just as difficult
   to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the experienced
   hacker.</para>

   <para> [very common; historically, &lsquo;according to religious
   law&rsquo;] The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word
   has a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas such as
   <literal>9 + x</literal> and <literal>x +
   9</literal> are said to be equivalent because they mean the same
   thing, but the second one is in <emphasis role='firstterm'>canonical
   form</emphasis> because it is written in the usual way, with the highest
   power of <literal>x</literal> first.  Usually there are fixed
   rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its present
   loading in computer-science culture largely through its prominence in
   Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and mathematical logic (see
   <glossterm>Knights of the Lambda Calculus</glossterm>).  Compare
   <glossterm>vanilla</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Non-technical academics do not use the adjective
   &lsquo;canonical&rsquo; in any of the senses defined above with any
   regularity; they do however use the nouns <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>canon</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>canonicity</emphasis> (not **canonicalness or
   **canonicality). The <emphasis role='firstterm'>canon</emphasis> of a given
   author is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage
   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary scholars).
   &lsquo;<emphasis>The</emphasis> canon&rsquo; is the body of works in a
   given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.</para>

   <para>The word &lsquo;canon&rsquo; has an interesting history.  It derives
   ultimately from the Greek
   <foreignphrase>&kappa;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</foreignphrase> (akin to the
   English &lsquo;cane&rsquo;) referring to a reed.  Reeds were used for
   measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word &lsquo;canon&rsquo;
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of scriptures
   within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the
   religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this instance
   of a defined and accepted body of work.  Alongside this usage was the
   promulgation of &lsquo;canons&rsquo; (&lsquo;rules&rsquo;) for the
   government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages (<quote>according
   to religious law</quote>) derive from this use of the Latin
   &lsquo;canon&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new
   at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of jargon.
   Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as much of it
   as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally,
   in one conversation, he used the word <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>canonical</emphasis> in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: <quote>Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!</quote> Stallman: <quote>What did he say?</quote> Steele: <quote>Bob
   just used &lsquo;canonical&rsquo; in the canonical way.</quote></para>

   <para>Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way <emphasis>hackers</emphasis> normally expect things to
   be.  Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that &lsquo;according to
   religious law&rsquo; is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the canonical meaning of
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>canonical</emphasis>.</para>

   <para>The term &lsquo;cargo cult&rsquo; is a reference to aboriginal

   <para> [from LISP] To skip past the first item from a list of things

   <para>Historical note: The instruction format of the IBM 704 that hosted

   <para>The cdr and car operations have since become bases for formation of

   <para>There is an urban legend that <emphasis

   keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the
   card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a
   circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make
   them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be
   &lsquo;chad&rsquo;.  However, serious attempts to track down
   <quote>Chadless</quote> as a personal name or U.S. trademark have failed,
   casting doubt on this etymology &mdash; and the U.S. Patent Classification
   System uses <quote>chadless</quote> (small c) as an adjective, suggesting
   that <quote>chadless</quote> derives from <quote>chad</quote> and not the
   other way around.  There is another legend that the word was originally
   acronymic, standing for <quote>Card Hole Aggregate Debris</quote>, but this
   has all the earmarks of a <glossterm>backronym</glossterm>.  It has also
   been noted that the word <quote>chad</quote> is Scots dialect for gravel,

   esp. in Israel (e.g. <quote>Our new colleague is a complete

   <quote>chainik</quote> subsection for newbies and, well, old chainiks (eg.
   su.asm.chainik, ru.linux.chainik, ru.html.chainik). Public projects often
   have a chainik mailing list to keep the chainiks off the developers' and
   experienced users' discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into
   mainstream Russian due to the Russian translation of the popular
   yellow-black covered <quote>foobar for dummies</quote> series, which
   (correctly) uses <quote>chainik</quote> for <quote>dummy</quote>, but its

   in revolt against the promiscuous use of &lsquo;word&rsquo; for anything

   brand name of a variety of chewing gum that does in fact resemble the keys
   of chiclet keyboards.)  Used esp. to describe the original IBM PCjr

   <para>A syndrome of certain Iomega ZIP drives, named for the clicking noise
   that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after accepting a

   common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a
   paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. <quote>Clicked</quote>
   disks are generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive.</para>

   <para>The clicking noise is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping
   against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk,
   causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive has
   been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to an
   electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT.  Another common cause
   is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip
   at a store. When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can
   demagnetize the disks, wiping out track 0.</para>

   <para>There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease;
   a <quote>clicked</quote> disk can cause the read/write head of a "clean"
   drive to become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the
   click of death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives
   affected by the condition.</para>

   <para> Hackish speech makes heavy use of pseudo-mathematical metaphors.
   Four particularly important ones involve the terms <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>coefficient</emphasis>, <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>factor</emphasis>, <emphasis role='firstterm'>index of
   X</emphasis>, and <emphasis role='firstterm'>quotient</emphasis>.  They are
   often loosely applied to things you cannot really be quantitative about,
   but there are subtle distinctions among them that convey information about
   the way the speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing.
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>Foo factor</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>foo quotient</emphasis> tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical example is
   <glossterm>fudge factor</glossterm>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.  You
   might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.  Quotient tends to
   imply that the property is a ratio of two opposing factors: <quote>I would
   have won except for my luck quotient.</quote> This could also be <quote>I
   would have won except for the luck factor</quote>, but using
   <emphasis>quotient</emphasis> emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering
   good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering your own).  <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>Foo index</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>coefficient of foo</emphasis> both tend to imply that foo
   is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that can be larger or
   smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or person as having a <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>high bogosity index</emphasis>, whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a <emphasis role='firstterm'>high bogosity
   factor</emphasis>.  <emphasis role='firstterm'>Foo index</emphasis>
   suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; <emphasis role='firstterm'>coefficient of
   foo</emphasis> suggests that foo is a fundamental quantity, as in a
   coefficient of friction.  The choice between these terms is often one of
   personal preference; e.g., some people might feel that bogosity is a
   fundamental attribute and thus say <emphasis role='firstterm'>coefficient
   of bogosity</emphasis>, whereas others might feel it is a combination of
   factors and thus say <emphasis role='firstterm'>bogosity
   index</emphasis>.</para>

   <para> Any very unusual character, particularly one you can't type because
   it isn't on your keyboard.  MIT people used to complain about the
   &lsquo;control-meta-cokebottle&rsquo; commands at SAIL, and SAIL people
   complained right back about the &lsquo;escape-escape-cokebottle&rsquo;
   commands at MIT.  After the demise of the <glossterm>space-cadet
   keyboard</glossterm>, <emphasis role='firstterm'>cokebottle</emphasis>
   faded away as serious usage, but was often invoked humorously to describe
   an (unspecified) weird or non-intuitive keystroke command.  It may be due
   for a second inning, however.  The OSF/Motif window manager,
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>mwm</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
   has a reserved keystroke for switching to the default set of keybindings
   and behavior.  This keystroke is (believe it or not)
   &lsquo;control-meta-bang&rsquo; (see <glossterm>bang</glossterm>).  Since
   the exclamation point looks a lot like an upside down Coke bottle, Motif
   hackers have begun referring to this keystroke as <emphasis

   <para> A semi-mythical language construct dual to the &lsquo;go to&rsquo;;
   <command remap='code'>COME FROM</command> &lt;label&gt; would cause the
   referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever
   reached it control would quietly and <glossterm>automagically</glossterm>
   be transferred to the statement following the <command remap='code'>COME
   FROM</command>.  <command remap='code'>COME FROM</command> was first
   proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's <citetitle>A Linguistic Contribution to
   GOTO-less programming</citetitle>, which appeared in a 1973
   <glossterm>Datamation</glossterm> issue (and was reprinted in the April
   1984 issue of <citetitle>Communications of the ACM</citetitle>).  This
   parodied the then-raging &lsquo;structured programming&rsquo;
   <glossterm>holy wars</glossterm> (see <glossterm>considered
   harmful</glossterm>).  Mythically, some variants are the <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>assigned COME FROM</emphasis> and the <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>computed COME FROM</emphasis> (parodying some nasty
   control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than
   one <command remap='code'>COME FROM</command> statement coming from the
   same label.</para>

   <para>In some ways the FORTRAN <command remap='code'>DO</command> looks
   like a <command remap='code'>COME FROM</command> statement.  After the
   terminating statement number/<command remap='code'>CONTINUE</command> is
   reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.  Some
   generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than <command
   remap='code'>CONTINUE</command>) for the statement, leading to examples
   like:</para>

<programlisting>
      DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
      WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
 10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)
</programlisting>

   <para>in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.  (This
   is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear to have
   anything to do with the flow of control at all!)  While sufficiently
   astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of <command
   remap='code'>COME FROM</command> statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975
   (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040 ten years
   earlier).  The statement <command remap='code'>AT 100</command> would
   perform a <command remap='code'>COME FROM 100</command>.  It was intended
   strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so
   deranged as to use it in production code.  More horrible things had already
   been perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the <command remap='code'>ALTER</command> verb in
   <glossterm>COBOL</glossterm>.  <command remap='code'>COME FROM</command>
   was supported under its own name for the first time 15 years later, in
   C-INTERCAL (see <glossterm>INTERCAL</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>retrocomputing</glossterm>); knowledgeable observers are still
   reeling from the shock.</para>

   <para> Hacker jargon as spoken in English outside the U.S., esp. in the
   British Commonwealth.  It is reported that Commonwealth speakers are more
   likely to pronounce truncations like &lsquo;char&rsquo; and
   &lsquo;soc&rsquo;, etc., as spelled (<emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/char/</emphasis>, <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/sok/</emphasis>), as opposed to American <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/keir/</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/sohsh/</emphasis>.  Dots in
   <glossterm>newsgroup</glossterm> names (especially two-component names)
   tend to be pronounced more often (so soc.wibble is <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/sok dot wib&acute;l/</emphasis> rather than <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/sohsh wib&acute;l/</emphasis>).</para>

   <para>Preferred <glossterm>metasyntactic variable</glossterm>s include
   <glossterm>blurgle</glossterm>, <command remap='code'>eek</command>,
   <command remap='code'>ook</command>, <command remap='code'>frodo</command>,
   and <command remap='code'>bilbo</command>; <glossterm>wibble</glossterm>,
   <command remap='code'>wobble</command>, and in emergencies <command

   <glossterm>womble</glossterm> and so on and on (see
   <glossterm>foo</glossterm>, sense 4).  Alternatives to verb doubling
   include suffixes <emphasis role='firstterm'>-o-rama</emphasis>, <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>frenzy</emphasis> (as in feeding frenzy), and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>city</emphasis> (examples: <quote>barf city!</quote>
   <quote>hack-o-rama!</quote> <quote>core dump frenzy!</quote>).</para>

   <para>All the generic differences within the anglophone world inevitably
   show themselves in the associated hackish dialects.  The Greek letters beta
   and zeta are usually pronounced <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/bee&acute;t&schwa;/</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/zee&acute;t&schwa;/</emphasis>; meta may also be
   pronounced <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/mee&acute;t&schwa;/</emphasis>.
   Various punctuators (and even letters - Z is called &lsquo;zed&rsquo;, not
   &lsquo;zee&rsquo;) are named differently: most crucially, for hackish,
   where Americans use &lsquo;parens&rsquo;, &lsquo;brackets&rsquo; and
   `braces' for (), [] and {}, Commonwealth English uses
   &lsquo;brackets&rsquo;, &lsquo;square brackets&rsquo; and &lsquo;curly
   brackets&rsquo;, though &lsquo;parentheses&rsquo; may be used for the
   first; the exclamation mark, &lsquo;!&rsquo;, is called pling rather than
   bang and the pound sign, &lsquo;#&rsquo;, is called hash; furthermore, the
   term &lsquo;the pound sign&rsquo; is understood to mean the &pound; (of
   course).  Canadian hacker slang, as with mainstream language, mixes
   American and British usages about evenly.</para>

   <para> Of a design, describes the valuable property that it can all be

   or lack of power; for example, C is compact and FORTRAN is not, but C is
   more powerful than FORTRAN.  Designs become non-compact through accreting

   <para> 2. A mythical subatomic particle that bears the unit quantity of
   computation or information, in much the same way that an electron bears one
   unit of electric charge (see also <glossterm>bogon</glossterm>).  An
   elaborate pseudo-scientific theory of computrons has been developed based
   on the physical fact that the molecules in a solid object move more rapidly
   as it is heated.  It is argued that an object melts because the molecules
   have lost their information about where they are supposed to be (that is,
   they have emitted computrons).  This explains why computers get so hot and
   require air conditioning; they use up computrons.  Conversely, it should be
   possible to cool down an object by placing it in the path of a computron
   beam.  It is believed that this may also explain why machines that work at
   the factory fail in the computer room: the computrons there have been all
   used up by the other hardware.  (The popularity of this theory probably
   owes something to the <citetitle>Warlock</citetitle> stories by Larry
   Niven, the best known being <citetitle>What Good is a Glass
   Dagger?</citetitle>, in which magic is fueled by an exhaustible natural
   resource called <foreignphrase>mana</foreignphrase>.)</para>

   <para> [very common] Edsger W. Dijkstra's note in the March 1968
   <citetitle>Communications of the ACM</citetitle>, <citetitle>Goto Statement
   Considered Harmful</citetitle>, fired the first salvo in the structured
   programming wars (text at <ulink
   url='http://www.acm.org/classics/'>http://www.acm.org/classics/</ulink>).
   As it <ulink url='http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26585.html'> turns
   out</ulink>, the title under which the letter appeared was actually
   supplied by CACM's editor, Niklaus Wirth.  Amusingly, the ACM considered
   the resulting acrimony sufficiently harmful that it will (by policy) no
   longer print an article taking so assertive a position against a coding
   practice. (Years afterwards, a contrary view was uttered in a CACM letter
   called, inevitably, <citetitle>&lsquo;Goto considered harmful&rsquo;
   considered harmful'</citetitle>'.  In the ensuing decades, a large number
   of both serious papers and parodies have borne titles of the form
   <citetitle>X considered Y</citetitle>.  The structured-programming wars
   eventually blew over with the realization that both sides were wrong, but
   use of such titles has remained as a persistent minor in-joke (the
   &lsquo;considered silly&rsquo; found at various places in this lexicon is
   related).</para>

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not explain
   random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays.
   So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,
   and used two identical boards for testing.  One was placed in the safe, one
   outside.  The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit
   drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between the
   error rates on the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.
   Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser degree
   uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is impossible to
   eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the
   earth's crust, with the statistically insignificant exception of uranium
   lodes) it became obvious that one has to design memories to withstand these
   hits.</para>

   the brainwashed androids of IPM (Impossible to Program Machines) to conquer
   and destroy the peaceful denizens of HEC (Human Engineered Computers).
   This rather transparent allegory featured many references to
   <glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm> and the immortal line <quote>Eat flaming
   death, minicomputer mongrels!</quote> (uttered, of course, by an IPM
   stormtrooper).  The whole shebang is now <ulink
   url='http://www.e-pix.com/CPUWARS/cpuwars.html'> available on the
   Web</ulink>.</para>

   <para>It is alleged that the author subsequently received a letter of
   appreciation on IBM company stationery from the head of IBM's Thomas
   J. Watson Research Laboratories (at that time one of the few islands of
   true hackerdom in the IBM archipelago).  The lower loop of the B in the IBM
   logo, it is said, had been carefully whited out.  See

<glossdef>
   <para> One who breaks security on a system.  Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in
   defense against journalistic misuse of <glossterm>hacker</glossterm> (q.v.,
   sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>worm</emphasis> in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet
   was largely a failure.</para>
<!-- from Steven Grady <grady@hermes.berkeley.edu>, 24 May 1990 -->

   <para>Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the
   theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism
   <quote>cracker</quote> in this sense may have been influenced not so much
   by the term <quote>safe-cracker</quote> as by the non-jargon term
   <quote>cracker</quote>, which in Middle English meant an obnoxious person
   (e.g., <quote>What cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this
   abundance of superfluous breath?</quote> &mdash; Shakespeare's King John, Act
   II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial American English survives as a barely
   gentler synonym for <quote>white trash</quote>.</para>

   <para>While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
   cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past
   <glossterm>larval stage</glossterm> is expected to have outgrown the desire
   to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if
   it's necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).</para>

   <para>Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than
   the <glossterm>mundane</glossterm> reader misled by sensationalistic
   journalism might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,
   very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to describe
   <emphasis>themselves</emphasis> as hackers, most true hackers consider them
   a separate and lower form of life.  An easy way for outsiders to spot
   the difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal
   their identities.  Hackers never do this; they only rarely use
   <foreignphrase>noms de guerre</foreignphrase> at all, and when they
   do it is for display rather than concealment.</para>

   <para>Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than breaking
   into someone else's has to be pretty <glossterm>losing</glossterm>.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the entries on
   <glossterm>cracking</glossterm> and <glossterm>phreaking</glossterm>.  See
   also <glossterm>samurai</glossterm>, 
   <glossterm>dark-side hacker</glossterm>, and <glossterm>hacker ethic</glossterm>.  For a
   portrait of the typical teenage cracker, see

   <para>An excellent example of crippleware (sense 3) is Intel's 486SX chip,
   which is a standard 486DX chip with the co-processor diked out (in some

   <para> 1. An awkward feature or programming technique that ought to be made
   cleaner.  For example, using small integers to represent error codes
   without the program interpreting them to the user (as in, for example, Unix
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>make</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>,

<glossdef>
   <para> 2. A technique that works acceptably, but which is quite prone to
   failure if disturbed in the least.  For example, a too-clever programmer
   might write an assembler which mapped instruction mnemonics to numeric
   opcodes algorithmically, a trick which depends far too intimately on the
   particular bit patterns of the opcodes.  (For another example of
   programming with a dependence on actual opcode values, see 
   <link linkend='story-of-mel'>The Story of Mel'</link> in Appendix A.)  Many crocks have a tightly woven,
   almost completely unmodifiable structure.  See

   <para> To write a software or document distribution on magnetic tape for
   shipment.  Has nothing to do with physically cutting the medium!  Early
   versions of this lexicon claimed that one never analogously speaks of
   &lsquo;cutting a disk&rsquo;, but this has since been reported as live
   usage.  Related slang usages are mainstream business's &lsquo;cut a
   check&rsquo;, the recording industry's &lsquo;cut a record&rsquo;, and the
   military's &lsquo;cut an order&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>All of these usages reflect physical processes in obsolete recording
   and duplication technologies.  The first stage in manufacturing an
   old-style vinyl record involved cutting grooves in a stamping die with a
   precision lathe.  More mundanely, the dominant technology for mass
   duplication of paper documents in pre-photocopying days involved
   <quote>cutting a stencil</quote>, punching away portions of the wax overlay
   on a silk screen.  More directly, paper tape with holes punched in it was
   an important early storage medium.  See also

   <para> [orig. by SF writer Bruce Bethke and/or editor Gardner Dozois] A
   subgenre of SF launched in 1982 by William Gibson's epoch-making novel
   <citetitle>Neuromancer</citetitle> (though its roots go back through Vernor
   Vinge's <citetitle>True Names</citetitle> (see the <link
   linkend='bibliography'>Bibliography</link> in Appendix C) to John
   Brunner's 1975 novel <citetitle>The Shockwave Rider</citetitle>).  Gibson's
   near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture
   enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the
   future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly na&iuml;ve and
   tremendously stimulating.  Gibson's work was widely imitated, in particular
   by the short-lived but innovative <citetitle>Max Headroom</citetitle> TV
   series.  See <glossterm>cyberspace</glossterm>, <glossterm>ice</glossterm>,

   <para>Since 1990 or so, popular culture has included a movement or fashion
   trend that calls itself &lsquo;cyberpunk&rsquo;, associated especially with
   the rave/techno subculture.  Hackers have mixed feelings about this.  On
   the one hand, self-described cyberpunks too often seem to be shallow
   trendoids in black leather who have substituted enthusiastic blathering
   about technology for actually learning and <emphasis>doing</emphasis> it.
   Attitude is no substitute for competence.  On the other hand, at least
   cyberpunks are excited about the right things and properly respectful of
   hacking talent in those who have it.  The general consensus is to tolerate
   them politely in hopes that they'll attract people who grow into being true
   hackers.</para>

   <para> [from Maxwell's Demon, later incorrectly retronymed as &lsquo;Disk
   And Execution MONitor&rsquo;] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but
   lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that the
   perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking
   (though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it
   will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example, under
   <glossterm>ITS</glossterm>, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory
   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.  The
   advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need
   neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT.
   They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to
   do with them.  Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and
   may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals.</para>

   what ITS called a <glossterm>dragon</glossterm>; the prototype was a
   program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file
   system.  Although the meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think
   this glossary reflects current (2003) usage.</para>

   <para> [Unix: from IBM <glossterm>JCL</glossterm>] Equivalent to
   <glossterm>cat</glossterm> or <glossterm>BLT</glossterm>.  Originally the
   name of a Unix copy command with special options suitable for
   block-oriented devices; it was often used in heavy-handed system
   maintenance, as in <quote>Let's <command remap='code'>dd</command> the root
   partition onto a tape, then use the boot PROM to load it back on to a new
   disk</quote>.  The Unix
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
   was designed with a weird, distinctly non-Unixy keyword option syntax
   reminiscent of IBM System/360 JCL (which had an elaborate DD &lsquo;Dataset
   Definition&rsquo; specification for I/O devices); though the command filled
   a need, the interface design was clearly a prank.  The jargon usage is now
   very rare outside Unix sites and now nearly obsolete even there, as
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>dd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
   has been <glossterm>deprecated</glossterm> for a long time (though it has

   <para> 1. Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other

   <para> 3. Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early
   <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> hardware and CP/M.  The PDP-10 Reference
   Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation
   for DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'>
<para>Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for <quote>DEC Debugging
Tape</quote>.  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has
propagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are now
available for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape are
now frequently used, the more descriptive name <quote>Dynamic Debugging
Technique</quote> has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.  Confusion
between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane 
C<subscript>14</subscript>H<subscript>9</subscript>Cl<subscript>5</subscript>
should be minimal since each attacks a
different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs.</para>
</blockquote>

   <para>(The &lsquo;tape&rsquo; referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic
   but paper.)  Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
   handbook after the <glossterm>suit</glossterm>s took over and
   <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> became much more
   &lsquo;businesslike&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
   more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm>
   lexicon, reports that he named <emphasis role='firstterm'>DDT</emphasis>
   after a similar tool on the TX-0 computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1
   built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957.  The debugger on that ground-breaking
   machine rejoiced in the name FLIT (FLexowriter Interrogation Tape).  Flit
   was for many years the trade-name of a popular insecticide.</para>

   <para> 1. [techspeak] A situation wherein two or more processes are unable
   to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something.
   A common example is a program communicating to a server, which may find
   itself waiting for output from the server before sending anything more to
   it, while the server is similarly waiting for more input from the
   controlling program before outputting anything.  (It is reported that this
   particular flavor of deadlock is sometimes called a <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>starvation deadlock</emphasis>, though the term <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>starvation</emphasis> is more properly used for situations
   where a program can never run simply because it never gets high enough
   priority.  Another common flavor is <emphasis

   to send stuff to the other but all buffers are full because nobody is
   reading anything.)  See <glossterm>deadly embrace</glossterm>.  </para>

   <para> <emphasis role='grammar'>n.</emphasis> Commonly used abbreviation
   for Digital Equipment Corporation, later deprecated by DEC itself in favor
   of <quote>Digital</quote> and now entirely obsolete following the buyout by
   Compaq.  Before the <glossterm>killer micro</glossterm> revolution of the
   late 1980s, hackerdom was closely symbiotic with DEC's pioneering
   timesharing machines.  The first of the group of cultures described by this
   lexicon nucleated around the PDP-1 (see <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm>).
   Subsequently, the PDP-6, <glossterm>PDP-10</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>PDP-20</glossterm>, <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> were all foci of large and important hackerdoms,
   and DEC machines long dominated the ARPANET and Internet machine
   population.  DEC was the technological leader of the minicomputer era
   (roughly 1967 to 1987), but its failure to embrace microcomputers and Unix
   early cost it heavily in profits and prestige after
   <glossterm>silicon</glossterm> got cheap.  Nevertheless, the microprocessor
   design tradition owes a major debt to the <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>
   instruction set, and every one of the major general-purpose microcomputer
   OSs so far (CP/M, MS-DOS, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT) was either genetically
   descended from a DEC OS, or incubated on DEC hardware, or both.
   Accordingly, DEC was for many years still regarded with a certain wry
   affection even among many hackers too young to have grown up on DEC
   machines.</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> [also &lsquo;demo scene&rsquo;] A culture of multimedia hackers
   located primarily in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore
   recounts that when old-time <glossterm>warez d00dz</glossterm> cracked some
   piece of software they often added an advertisement in the beginning,
   usually containing colorful <glossterm>display hack</glossterm>s with
   greetings to other cracking groups.  The demoscene was born among people
   who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than hacking
   &mdash; or anyway safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police
   pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into
   bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for
   esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained
   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture
   such a hack is called a <glossterm>demo</glossterm>).  As more of these
   <glossterm>demogroup</glossterm>s emerged, they started to have
   <glossterm>compo</glossterm>s at copying parties (see
   <glossterm>copyparty</glossterm>), which later evolved to standalone events
   (see <glossterm>demoparty</glossterm>).  The demoscene has retained some
   traits from the <glossterm>warez d00dz</glossterm>, including their style
   of handles and group names and some of their jargon.</para>

   <para>Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
   smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.
   Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of
   years after that, they also started using Java.</para>

   <para>Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its
   original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die
   out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet.  While
   deeply underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the
   mainstream as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the
   commercialization of bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this,
   but the majority think it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up
   working in the computer game industry.  Demoscene resource pages are
   available at <ulink

   effective to attack software problems by reducing complexity than by

   &lsquo;diagonal cutters&rsquo;, a kind of wire cutter. To &lsquo;dike
   something out&rsquo; means to use such cutters to remove something. Indeed,
   the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as <quote>to attack with

   glory days of the 1960s, it was &lsquo;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs&rsquo;:
   Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac.
   RCA and GE sold out early, and it was &lsquo;IBM and the Bunch&rsquo;
   (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.
   Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form
   Unisys (in 1984 &mdash; this was when the phrase <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>dinosaurs mating</emphasis> was coined); and in 1991
   AT&amp;T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later). Control
   Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business.  In similar
   wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate after
   1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by
   Hewlett-Packard.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem
   inevitable.</para>

   <para> [play on &lsquo;Associated Press&rsquo;; perhaps inspired by a

   Doc?</citetitle>] An algorithm for transforming any text into potentially
   humorous garbage even more efficiently than by passing it through a
   <glossterm>marketroid</glossterm>.  The algorithm starts by printing any
   <literal>N</literal> consecutive words (or letters) in the text.  Then at
   every step it searches for any random occurrence in the original text of
   the last <literal>N</literal> words (or letters) already printed and then
   prints the next word or letter.  <glossterm>EMACS</glossterm> has a handy
   command for this.  Here is a short example of word-based Dissociated Press
   applied to an earlier version of this Jargon File:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'><para>
wart: <emphasis role='grammar'>n.</emphasis> A small, crocky
<glossterm>feature</glossterm> that sticks out of an array (C has no checks

so as to be not worth paying attention to the medium in question.

   <para>A hackish idle pastime is to apply letter-based Dissociated Press to

   of finding an interesting new word.  (In the preceding example,

   the person to whom they're responding.  For example, when a religious

   It has been suggested that this derives from U.S. football slang for a
   tackle involving three or more people; among hackers, it seems at least as
   likely to derive from an &lsquo;autobiographical&rsquo; Bugs Bunny cartoon

   <para> 1. [now obs.] A security or <glossterm>copy protection</glossterm>
   device for proprietary software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some
   drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port
   of the computer while the program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query
   the port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate
   if it does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus,
   users can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for
   each dongle.  The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a
   software product called PaperClip.  The idea was clever, but it was
   initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. By
   1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor for
   <glossterm>magic</glossterm> codes (and combinations of status lines) with
   minimal if any interference with devices further down the line &mdash; this
   innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces

   away from the home position on the keyboard.  It was half-seriously
   suggested that the extra shifting keys be implemented as pedals; typing on
   such a keyboard would be very much like playing a full pipe organ.  This
   idea is mentioned in a parody of a very fine song by Jeffrey Moss called
   <citetitle>Rubber Duckie</citetitle>, which was published in <citetitle>The
   Sesame Street Songbook</citetitle> (Simon and Schuster 1971, ISBN
   0-671-21036-X).  These lyrics were written on May 27, 1978, in celebration
   of the Stanford keyboard:</para>

			Double Bucky

	Double bucky, you're the one!
	You make my keyboard lots of fun.
	    Double bucky, an additional bit or two:

	Augmented ASCII, nine bits wide!
	    Double bucky!  Half a thousand glyphs, plus a few!
		Oh,

		Perhaps a

		Double double bucky!
	Double bucky, left and right
	OR'd together, outta sight!

   was doused in cleaner, which restored it for a while.  However, this
   operation left a fine residue that accelerated the accumulation of cruft,

   declared &lsquo;alcoholic&rsquo; and sent to the clinic to be dried out in
   a CFC ultrasonic bath.</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> The most dramatic use yet seen of 
   <glossterm>fall through</glossterm> in C, invented by Tom Duff when he was at Lucasfilm.
   Trying to optimize all the instructions he could out of an inner loop that
   copied data serially onto an output port, he decided to unroll it.  He then
   realized that the unrolled version could be implemented by
   <emphasis>interlacing</emphasis> the structures of a switch and a
   loop:</para>

<programlisting>
   register n = (count + 7) / 8;      /* count &gt; 0 assumed */

   switch (count % 8)
   {
   case 0:        do {  *to = *from++;
   case 7:              *to = *from++;
   case 6:              *to = *from++;
   case 5:              *to = *from++;
   case 4:              *to = *from++;
   case 3:              *to = *from++;
   case 2:              *to = *from++;
   case 1:              *to = *from++;
                      } while (--n &gt; 0);
   }
</programlisting>

   <para>Shocking though it appears to all who encounter it for the first
   time, the device is actually perfectly valid, legal C.  C's default
   <glossterm>fall through</glossterm> in case statements has long been its
   most controversial single feature; Duff observed that <quote>This code
   forms some sort of argument in that debate, but I'm not sure whether it's
   for or against.</quote> Duff has discussed the device in detail at <ulink
   url='http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html'>http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/duffs-device.html</ulink>.
   Note that the omission of postfix <command remap='code'>++</command> from
   <command remap='code'>*to</command> was intentional (though confusing).
   Duff's device can be used to implement memory copy, but the original aim
   was to copy values serially into a magic IO register.</para>

   <para>Warren Teitelman originally wrote DWIM to fix his typos and spelling
   errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often make
   hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.  Some
   victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for &lsquo;Damn
   Warren&rsquo;s Infernal Machine!'.</para>

   <para>In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command
   interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker there typed
   <command remap='code'>delete *$</command> to free up some disk space.  (The
   editor there named backup files by appending <command
   remap='code'>$</command> to the original file name, so he was trying to
   delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened
   that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported
   <command remap='code'>*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete
   *'.</command> It then started to delete all the files on the disk!  The
   hacker managed to stop it with a <glossterm>Vulcan nerve pinch</glossterm>
   after only a half dozen or so files were lost.</para>

   <para>The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to
   Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation,
   and then type <command remap='code'>delete *$</command> twice.</para>

   <para>DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
   program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the
   ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of program correctness were in
   vogue, there were also jokes about <emphasis

   <para>[abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An
   alleged character set used on IBM <glossterm>dinosaur</glossterm>s.  It
   exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such
   delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of several
   ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern computer languages
   (exactly which characters are absent varies according to which version of
   EBCDIC you're looking at).  IBM adapted EBCDIC from 
   <glossterm>punched card</glossterm> code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a
   customer-control tactic (see <glossterm>connector conspiracy</glossterm>),
   spurning the already established ASCII standard.  Today, IBM claims to be
   an open-systems company, but IBM's own description of the EBCDIC variants
   and how to convert between them is still internally classified top-secret,
   burn-before-reading.  Hackers blanch at the very <emphasis>name</emphasis>

   <para> The road mundanely called El Camino Real, running along San
   Francisco peninsula.  It originally extended all the way down to Mexico
   City; many portions of the old road are still intact.  Navigation on the
   San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real, which
   defines <glossterm>logical</glossterm> north and south even though it isn't
   really north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past Stanford
   University and so is familiar to hackers.</para>

   <para>The Spanish word &lsquo;real&rsquo; (which has two syllables:
   <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/ray&middot;ahl&acute;/</emphasis>) means
   &lsquo;royal&rsquo;; El Camino Real is &lsquo;the royal road&rsquo;.  In
   the FORTRAN language, a <emphasis role='firstterm'>real</emphasis> quantity
   is a number typically precise to seven significant digits, and a <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>double precision</emphasis> quantity is a larger
   floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant digits
   (other languages have similar <emphasis role='firstterm'>real</emphasis>
   types).</para>

   <para>When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
   long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on &lsquo;real&rsquo;, he
   started calling it &lsquo;El Camino Double Precision&rsquo; &mdash; but
   when the hacker was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he
   renamed it &lsquo;El Camino Bignum&rsquo;, and that name has stuck.  (See
   <glossterm>bignum</glossterm>.)</para>

   fact himself &mdash;ESR]</para>

   <para> [AI community] The tendency of humans to attach associations to
   terms from prior experience.  For example, there is nothing magic about the
   symbol <literal>+</literal> that makes it well-suited to indicate addition;
   it's just that people associate it with addition.  Using
   <literal>+</literal> or &lsquo;plus&rsquo; to mean addition in a computer
   language is taking advantage of the ELIZA effect.</para>

   <para>This term comes from the famous ELIZA program by Joseph Weizenbaum,
   which simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by re&shy;phrasing many of the
   patient's statements as questions and posing them to the patient.  It
   worked by simple pattern recognition and substitution of key words into
   canned phrases.  It was so convincing, however, that there are many
   anecdotes about people becoming very emotionally caught up in dealing with
   ELIZA.  All this was due to people's tendency to attach to words meanings
   which the computer never put there.  The ELIZA effect is a 
   <glossterm>Good Thing</glossterm> when writing a programming language, but it can blind you
   to serious shortcomings when analyzing an Artificial Intelligence system.

   <para> [from Editing MACroS] The ne plus ultra of hacker editors, a
   programmable text editor with an entire LISP system inside it.  It was
   originally written by Richard Stallman in <glossterm>TECO</glossterm> under
   <glossterm>ITS</glossterm> at the MIT AI lab; AI Memo 554 described it as
   <quote>an advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
   display editor</quote>.  It has since been reimplemented any number of
   times, by various hackers, and versions exist that run under most major
   operating systems.  Perhaps the most widely used version, also written by
   Stallman and now called <quote><glossterm>GNU</glossterm> EMACS</quote> or
   <glossterm>GNUMACS</glossterm>, runs principally under Unix.  (Its close
   relative XEmacs is the second most popular version.)  It includes
   facilities to run compilation subprocesses and send and receive mail or
   news; many hackers spend up to 80% of their <glossterm>tube
   time</glossterm> inside it.  Other variants include
   <glossterm>GOSMACS</glossterm>, CCA EMACS, UniPress EMACS, Montgomery
   EMACS, jove, epsilon, and MicroEMACS.  (Though we use the original all-caps
   spelling here, it is nowadays very commonly &lsquo;Emacs&rsquo;.)  Some
   EMACS versions running under window managers iconify as an overflowing
   kitchen sink, perhaps to suggest the one feature the editor does not (yet)
   include.  Indeed, some hackers find EMACS too
   <glossterm>heavyweight</glossterm> and <glossterm>baroque</glossterm> for
   their taste, and expand the name as &lsquo;Escape Meta Alt Control
   Shift&rsquo; to spoof its heavy reliance on keystrokes decorated with
   <glossterm>bucky bits</glossterm>.  Other spoof expansions include
   &lsquo;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&rsquo; (from when that was a
   lot of <glossterm>core</glossterm>), &lsquo;Eventually
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>malloc</refentrytitle><manvolnum></manvolnum></citerefentry>s
   All Computer Storage&rsquo;, and &lsquo;EMACS Makes A Computer Slow&rsquo;
   (see <glossterm>recursive acronym</glossterm>).  See also

   <para> [common] An ASCII glyph used to indicate an emotional state in email
   or news.  Although originally intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some
   other explicit humor indication) are virtually required under certain
   circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums such as Usenet;
   the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended
   to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious comments
   to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by
   <glossterm>newbie</glossterm>s), resulting in arguments and
   <glossterm>flame war</glossterm>s.</para>

   <para>Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
   common use.  These include: <informaltable> <tgroup cols='2'> <tbody>
   <row><entry>:-)</entry><entry>&lsquo;smiley face&rsquo; (for humor,
   laughter, friendliness, occasionally sarcasm)</entry></row>
   <row><entry>:-(</entry><entry>&lsquo;frowney face&rsquo; (for sadness,
   anger, or upset)</entry></row>
   <row><entry>;-)</entry><entry>&lsquo;half-smiley&rsquo; (
   <glossterm>ha ha only serious</glossterm>); also known as <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>semi-smiley</emphasis> or <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>winkey face</emphasis>.</entry></row>
   <row><entry>:-/</entry><entry>&lsquo;wry face&rsquo;</entry></row> </tbody>
   </tgroup> </informaltable> (These may become more comprehensible if you
   tilt your head sideways, to the left.)  The first two listed are by far the
   most frequently encountered.  Hyphenless forms of them are common on
   CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX; see also <glossterm>bixie</glossterm>.  On
   <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm>, <emphasis role='firstterm'>smiley</emphasis>
   is often used as a generic term synonymous with
   <glossterm>emoticon</glossterm>, as well as specifically for the happy-face
   emoticon.</para>
</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>The invention of the original smiley and frowney emoticons is
   generally credited to Scott Fahlman at CMU in 1982. He later wrote:
   <quote>I wish I had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date
   for posterity, but I had no idea that I was starting something that would
   soon pollute all the world's communication channels.</quote> In September
   2002 the original post <ulink
   url='http://research.microsoft.com/~mbj/Smiley/Smiley.html'> was
   recovered</ulink>.</para>

   <para>There is a rival claim by one Kevin McKenzie, who seems to have
   proposed the smiley on the MsgGroup mailing list, April 12 1979.  It seems
   likely these two inventions were independent.  Users of the PLATO
   educational system <ulink url=' http://www.platopeople.com/emoticons.html'>
   report</ulink> using emoticons composed from overlaid dot-matrix graphics
   in the 1970s.</para>

   <para>Note for the <glossterm>newbie</glossterm>: Overuse of the smiley is
   a mark of loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign
   that you've gone over the line.</para>

   <para> Any of a family of military simulations derived from a game written
   by Peter Langston many years ago.  A number of multi-player variants of
   varying degrees of sophistication exist, and one single-player version
   implemented for both Unix and VMS; the latter is even available as
   MS-DOS/Windows freeware.  All are notoriously addictive.  Of various
   commercial derivatives the best known is probably <quote>Empire
   Deluxe</quote> on PCs and Amigas.</para>
<!-- ESR 1983 -->

   <para>Modern empire is a real-time wargame played over the internet by up
   to 120 players. Typical games last from 24 hours (blitz) to a couple of
   months (long term).  The amount of sleep you can get while playing is a
   function of the rate at which updates occur and the number of co-rulers of
   your country.  Empire server software is available for Unix-like machines,
   and clients for Unix and other platforms.  A comprehensive history of the
   game is available at <ulink

   <para> [Unix: prob.: from astronomical timekeeping] The time and date
   corresponding to 0 in an operating system's clock and timestamp values.
   Under most Unix versions the epoch is 00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970; under
   VMS, it's 00:00:00 of November 17, 1858 (base date of the U.S. Naval
   Observatory's ephemerides); on a Macintosh, it's the midnight beginning
   January 1 1904.  System time is measured in seconds or
   <glossterm>tick</glossterm>s past the epoch.  Weird problems may ensue when
   the clock wraps around (see <glossterm>wrap around</glossterm>), which is
   not necessarily a rare event; on systems counting 10 ticks per second, a
   signed 32-bit count of ticks is good only for 6.8 years.  The
   1-tick-per-second clock of Unix is good only until January 18, 2038,
   assuming at least some software continues to consider it signed and that
   word lengths don't increase by then.  See also 
   <glossterm>wall time</glossterm>.  Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, has an epoch
   problem every 49.7 days &mdash; but this is seldom noticed as Windows is almost
   incapable of staying up continuously for that long.</para>

   <para> A shadowy group of mustachioed hackers named Eric first pinpointed

   doubtless influenced by the numerous &lsquo;Eric&rsquo; jokes in the Monty

   Eric Allman (he of the &lsquo;Allman style&rsquo; described under

   <para> Old-time hacker David Cargill's theory on the causation of computer
   glitches.  Your typical electric utility draws its line current out of the
   big generators with a pair of coil taps located near the top of the dynamo.
   When the normal tap brushes get dirty, they take them off line to clean
   them up, and use special auxiliary taps on the <emphasis>bottom</emphasis>
   of the coil.  Now, this is a problem, because when they do that they get
   not ordinary or &lsquo;thin&rsquo; electrons, but the fat'n'sloppy
   electrons that are heavier and so settle to the bottom of the generator.
   These flow down ordinary wires just fine, but when they have to turn a
   sharp corner (as in an integrated-circuit via), they're apt to get stuck.
   This is what causes computer glitches.  [Fascinating.  Obviously, fat
   electrons must gain mass by <glossterm>bogon</glossterm> absorption

   one subtle peril of iconic interfaces.</para>
<!-- from Stephane Poudret <spou@spou.dhs.org>, 25 Jan 2000 -->

   <para>Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is &lsquo;cross of St.
   Hannes&rsquo;, but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to mark sites
   of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from an early Mac
   developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple documentation gives the
   translation <quote>interesting feature</quote>!</para>

   <para>There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol.
   It technically stands for the word
   <foreignphrase>sev&auml;rdhet</foreignphrase> (thing worth seeing); many of
   these are old churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for the sign the
   word <emphasis role='firstterm'>kyrka</emphasis>, cognate to English
   &lsquo;church&rsquo; and pronounced (roughly) <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/chur&acute;ka/</emphasis> in modern Swedish.  Others
   say this is nonsense.  Other idioms reported for the sign are
   <foreignphrase>runa</foreignphrase> (rune) or <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>runsten</emphasis> <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/roon&acute;stn/</emphasis> (runestone), derived from
   the fact that many of the interesting features are Viking rune-stones.  The
   term <foreignphrase>fornminne</foreignphrase> <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/foorn&acute;min'&schwa;/</emphasis> (relic of
   antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported, especially among those who
   think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.</para>

   <para> 1. [common] A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary

   following problem: <quote>If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10
   feet apart, how many posts do you need?</quote> (Either 9 or 11 is a better
   answer than the obvious 10.)  For example, suppose you have a long list or
   array of items, and want to process items
   <literal>m</literal> through
   <literal>n</literal>; how many items are there?  The obvious
   answer is <literal>n - m</literal>, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is <literal>n - m + 1</literal>.  A program

   <glossterm>off-by-one error</glossterm>, and note that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost
   errors.  The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic off-by-one
   error where <literal>N</literal> people try to sit in
   <literal>N - 1</literal> chairs, but it's not a fencepost

   <para> [from SF fandom, where a typo for &lsquo;folk&rsquo; was adopted as
   a new word] Originally, a popular or folk song with lyrics revised or
   completely new lyrics and/or music, intended for humorous effect when read,
   and/or to be sung late at night at SF conventions.  More recently
   (especially since the late 1980s), filk has come to include a great deal of
   originally-composed music on SFnal or fantasy themes and a range of moods
   wider than simple parody or humor.  Worthy of mention here because there is
   a flourishing subgenre of filks called <emphasis role='firstterm'>computer

   sophisticated technical humor.  See <glossterm>double bucky</glossterm> for

   <para>The label &lsquo;Finagle's Law&rsquo; was popularized by SF author
   Larry Niven in several stories depicting a frontier culture of asteroid

   The change was scheduled for Flag Day (a U.S. holiday),
   June 14, 1966.</para>

   <para>The change altered the Multics definition of ASCII from the
   short-lived 1965 version of the ASCII code to the 1967 version (in draft at
   the time); this moved code points for braces, vertical bar, and

   in his time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced

   <para>&lsquo;Flush&rsquo; was standard ITS terminology for aborting an
   output operation; one spoke of the text that would have been printed, but
   was not, as having been flushed.  It is speculated that this term arose
   from a vivid image of flushing unwanted characters by hosing down the
   internal output buffer, washing the characters away before they could be
   printed.  The Unix/C usage, on the other hand, was propagated by the
   <citerefentry><refentrytitle>fflush</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
   call in C's standard I/O library (though it is reported to have been in use
   among BLISS programmers at <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> and on Honeywell and
   IBM machines as far back as 1965).  Unix/C hackers found the ITS usage
   confusing, and vice versa.</para>

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>When &lsquo;foo&rsquo; is used in connection with &lsquo;bar&rsquo;
   it has generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang acronym
   <glossterm>FUBAR</glossterm> (&lsquo;Fucked Up Beyond All Repair&rsquo; or
   &lsquo;Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition&rsquo;), later modified to
   <glossterm>foobar</glossterm>.  Early versions of the Jargon File
   interpreted this change as a post-war bowdlerization, but it it now seems
   more likely that FUBAR was itself a derivative of &lsquo;foo&rsquo; perhaps
   influenced by German <foreignphrase>furchtbar</foreignphrase> (terrible)
   &mdash; &lsquo;foobar&rsquo; may actually have been the
   <emphasis>original</emphasis> form.</para>

   <para>For, it seems, the word &lsquo;foo&rsquo; itself had an immediate
   prewar history in comic strips and cartoons.  The earliest documented uses
   were in the <citetitle>Smokey Stover</citetitle> comic strip published from
   about 1930 to about 1952.  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it
   with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases
   such as <quote>Notary Sojac</quote> and <quote>1506 nix nix</quote>.  The
   word <quote>foo</quote> frequently appeared on license plates of cars, in
   nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as <quote>He who
   foos last foos best</quote> or <quote>Many smoke but foo men chew</quote>),
   and Holman had Smokey say <quote>Where there's foo, there's
   fire</quote>.</para>

   <para>According to the <ulink url='http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/'>
   Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion</ulink> Holman claimed to have found the
   word <quote>foo</quote> on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is
   plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this
   one was almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word
   <foreignphrase>fu</foreignphrase> (sometimes transliterated
   <foreignphrase>foo</foreignphrase>), which can mean
   <quote>happiness</quote> or <quote>prosperity</quote> when spoken with the
   rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese
   restaurants are properly called <quote>fu dogs</quote>).  English speakers'
   reception of Holman's &lsquo;foo&rsquo; nonsense word was undoubtedly
   influenced by Yiddish &lsquo;feh&rsquo; and English &lsquo;fooey&rsquo; and
   &lsquo;fool&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on
   two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s,
   and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable
   version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to the Encyclopedia of American
   Comics, &lsquo;Foo&rsquo; fever swept the U.S., finding its way into
   popular songs and generating over 500 &lsquo;Foo Clubs.&rsquo; The fad left
   &lsquo;foo&rsquo; references embedded in popular culture (including a
   couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39; notably in
   Robert Clampett's <quote>Daffy Doc</quote> of 1938, in which a very early
   version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying <quote>SILENCE IS
   FOO!</quote>) When the fad faded, the origin of <quote>foo</quote> was
   forgotten.</para>

   <para>One place <quote>foo</quote> is known to have remained live is in the
   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term &lsquo;foo
   fighters&rsquo; was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious or
   spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced
   in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better
   grunge-rock bands).  Because informants connected the term directly to the
   Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that connects it to French
   <quote>feu</quote> (fire) can be gently dismissed.</para>

   <para>The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during
   the war (see <glossterm>kluge</glossterm> and <glossterm>kludge</glossterm>
   for another important example) Period sources reported that
   &lsquo;FOO&rsquo; became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army
   graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British
   troops went, the graffito <quote>FOO was here</quote> or something similar
   showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from
   Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous
   <quote>FUBAR</quote>) was probably a <glossterm>backronym</glossterm> .
   Forty years later, Paul Dickson's excellent book <quote>Words</quote>
   (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced <quote>Foo</quote> to an
   unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:
   <quote>Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter
   omniscience and sarcasm.</quote></para>

   <para>Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker
   usage actually sprang from <citetitle>FOO, Lampoons and Parody</citetitle>,
   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project
   of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens)
   later became one of the most important and influential artists in
   underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers
   later burned most of the existing copies in disgust.  The title FOO was
   featured in large letters on the front cover.  However, very few copies of
   this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's
   <foreignphrase>oeuvre</foreignphrase> have established that this title was
   a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.  The Crumbs may also have
   been influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named
   &lsquo;Foo&rsquo; published in 1951-52.</para>

   <para>An old-time member reports that in the 1959 <citetitle>Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language</citetitle>, compiled at <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm>,
   there was an entry that went something like this:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'><para>
FOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase <quote>FOO MANE PADME
HUM.</quote> Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.
</para></blockquote>

   <para>(For more about the legendary foo counters, see
   <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm>.)  This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense
   word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in popular
   culture and slang, to a <glossterm>ha ha only serious</glossterm> analogy
   with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to
   resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any
   less susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI
   Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from there.</para>

   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to
   create the graphics in the movie <citetitle>TRON</citetitle>.  The F-1 was
   the fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort
   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned towards
   building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines.  Unfortunately,
   these ran not the popular <glossterm>TOPS-20</glossterm> but a TENEX
   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also, the
   machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes
   requiring individual attention from more than usually competent site
   personnel, and thus had significant reliability problems.  Poole's
   legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help
   matters.  By the time DEC's <quote>Jupiter Project</quote> followon to the
   PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was
   eclipsed by the <glossterm>Mars</glossterm>, and the company never quite

   <para> In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or
   more) versions of a software package's source code are being developed in
   parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple versions
   of the source code have irreconcilable differences between them.  This
   should not be confused with a development branch, which may later be folded
   back into the original source code base.  Nor should it be confused with
   what happens when a new distribution of Linux or some other distribution is
   created, because that largely assembles pieces than can and will be used in
   other distributions without conflict.</para>

   <para>Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual
   instances loom large in hacker folklore.  Notable in this class were the
   Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the
   forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD operating systems.</para>

   software project is said to have forked or be forked when the project group
   fissions into two or more parts pursuing separate lines of development (or,

   <glossterm>Bad Thing</glossterm> &mdash; not merely because it implies a lot of wasted effort
   in the future, but because forks tend to be accompanied by a great deal of
   strife and acrimony between the successor groups over issues of legitimacy,
   succession, and design direction.  There is serious social pressure against
   forking.  As a result, major forks (such as the Gnu-Emacs/XEmacs split, the
   fissionings of the 386BSD group into three daughter projects, and the
   short-lived GCC/EGCS split) are rare enough that they are remembered
   individually in hacker folklore.  </para>

   the software for their private use, and free to redistribute it either with
   or without modifications, either commercially or noncommercially, either
   gratis or charging a distribution fee.  Free software has existed since the
   dawn of computing; Free Software as a movement began in 1984 with the GNU
   Project.</para>

   other 2-state devices.  Thus: <quote>Please frob the light switch</quote>
   (that is, flip it), but also <quote>Stop frobbing that clasp; you'll break
   it</quote>.  One also sees the construction <emphasis role='firstterm'>to
   frob a frob</emphasis>.  See <glossterm>tweak</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>twiddle</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Usage: frob, twiddle, and tweak sometimes connote points along a
   continuum.  &lsquo;Frob&rsquo; connotes aimless manipulation; <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>twiddle</emphasis> connotes gross manipulation, often a
   coarse search for a proper setting; <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>tweak</emphasis> connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is
   turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he
   is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
   screen, he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because
   turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.  The variant <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>frobnosticate</emphasis> has been recently
   reported.</para>

   <quote>FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people
   instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering
   [Amdahl] products.</quote> The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go
   with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment.  This implicit
   coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would
   happen to people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the
   future of competitors' equipment or software.  See
   <glossterm>IBM</glossterm>.  After 1990 the term FUD was associated
   increasingly frequently with <glossterm>Microsoft</glossterm>, and has
   become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a
   competitive weapon.</para>

   <para> [common] A value or parameter that is varied in an ad hoc way to
   produce the desired result.  The terms <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>tolerance</emphasis> and <glossterm>slop</glossterm> are
   also used, though these usually indicate a one-sided leeway, such as a

   how large it needs to be, and it is better to waste a little space than to
   lose completely for not having enough.  A fudge factor, on the other hand,
   can often be tweaked in more than one direction.  A good example is the

   Honeywell <glossterm>Multics</glossterm>, and (2) GECOS/GCOS left one
   permanent mark on Unix.  Some early Unix systems at Bell Labs used GCOS

</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>&lsquo;Gedanken&rsquo; is a German word for &lsquo;thought&rsquo;.  A
   thought experiment is one you carry out in your head.  In physics, the term
   <foreignphrase>gedanken experiment</foreignphrase> is used to refer to an
   experiment that is impractical to carry out, but useful to consider because
   it can be reasoned about theoretically.  (A classic gedanken experiment of
   relativity theory involves thinking about a man in an elevator accelerating
   through space.)  Gedanken experiments are very useful in physics, but must
   be used with care.  It's too easy to idealize away some important aspect of
   the real world in constructing the &lsquo;apparatus&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>Among hackers, accordingly, the word has a pejorative connotation.
   It is typically used of a project, especially one in artificial
   intelligence research, that is written up in grand detail (typically as a
   Ph.D.  thesis) without ever being implemented to any great extent.  Such a
   project is usually perpetrated by people who aren't very good hackers or
   find programming distasteful or are just in a hurry.  A <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>gedanken thesis</emphasis> is usually marked by an obvious
   lack of intuition about what is programmable and what is not, and about
   what does and does not constitute a clear specification of an algorithm.

   <para> A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one
   who pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not
   mainstream social acceptance.  Geeks usually have a strong case of
   <glossterm>neophilia</glossterm>. Most geeks are adept with computers and
   treat <glossterm>hacker</glossterm> as a term of respect, but not all are
   hackers themselves &mdash; and some who <emphasis>are</emphasis> in fact
   hackers normally call themselves geeks anyway, because they (quite
   properly) regard &lsquo;hacker&rsquo; as a label that should be bestowed by
   others rather than self-assumed.</para>

   <para>One <ulink url='http://www.darkwater.com/omni/geek.html'>
   description</ulink> accurately if a little breathlessly enumerates
   <quote>gamers, ravers, science fiction fans, punks, perverts, programmers,
   nerds, subgenii, and trekkies. These are people who did not go to their
   high school proms, and many would be offended by the suggestion that they
   should have even wanted to.</quote></para>

   <para>Originally, a <emphasis role='firstterm'>geek</emphasis> was a
   carnival performer who bit the heads off chickens.  (In early 20th-century
   Scotland a &lsquo;geek&rsquo; was an immature coley, a type of fish.)
   Before about 1990 usage of this term was rather negative.  Earlier versions
   of this lexicon defined a <emphasis role='firstterm'>computer
   geek</emphasis> as one who eats (computer) bugs for a living &mdash; an
   asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all the personality of a
   cheese grater.  This is often still the way geeks are regarded by
   non-geeks, but as the mainstream culture becomes more dependent on
   technology and technical skill mainstream attitudes have tended to shift
   towards grudging respect.  Correspondingly, there are now &lsquo;geek
   pride&rsquo; festivals (the implied reference to &lsquo;gay pride&rsquo; is
   not accidental).</para>

   <para> (also <quote>Code of the Geeks</quote>). A set of codes commonly
   used in <glossterm>sig block</glossterm>s to broadcast the interests,
   skills, and aspirations of the poster.  Features a G at the left margin
   followed by numerous letter codes, often suffixed with plusses or minuses.
   Because many net users are involved in computer science, the most common
   prefix is &lsquo;GCS&rsquo;.  To see a copy of the current code, browse
   <ulink url='http://www.geekcode.com/'>http://www.geekcode.com/</ulink>.
   Here is a sample geek code (that of Robert Hayden, the code's inventor)
   from that page:</para>

</literallayout>

   <para>The geek code originated in 1993; it was inspired (according to the
   inventor) by previous <quote>bear</quote>, <quote>smurf</quote> and
   <quote>twink</quote> style-and-sexual-preference codes from lesbian and gay
   <glossterm>newsgroup</glossterm>s. It has in turn spawned imitators; there
   is now even a <quote>Saturn geek code</quote> for owners of the Saturn car.

   <para> Pejorative name for some versions of the <glossterm>GNU</glossterm>
   project <glossterm>copyleft</glossterm> or General Public License (GPL),
   which requires that any tools or <glossterm>app</glossterm>s incorporating
   copylefted code must be source-distributed on the same anti-proprietary
   terms as GNU stuff.  Thus it is alleged that the copyleft
   &lsquo;infects&rsquo; software generated with GNU tools, which may in turn
   infect other software that reuses any of its code.  The Free Software
   Foundation's official position is that copyright law limits the scope of
   the GPL to <quote>programs textually incorporating significant amounts of
   GNU code</quote>, and that the &lsquo;infection&rsquo; is not passed on to
   third parties unless actual GNU source is transmitted.  Nevertheless,
   widespread suspicion that the <glossterm>copyleft</glossterm> language is
   &lsquo;boobytrapped&rsquo; has caused many developers to avoid using GNU
   tools and the GPL.  Changes in the language of the version 2.0 GPL did not

   <para> [Unix; common] To expand special characters in a wildcarded name, or

   wildcarding have become sufficiently pervasive that many hackers use some
   of them in written English, especially in email or news on technical

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols='2'>
<tbody>
<row><entry>*</entry><entry>wildcard for any string (see also <glossterm>UN*X</glossterm>)

   <para> 1. [acronym: &lsquo;GNU&rsquo;s Not Unix!', see <glossterm>recursive

   Software Foundation headed by Richard Stallman.  GNU EMACS and the GNU C
   compiler, two tools designed for this project, have become very popular in
   hackerdom and elsewhere.  The GNU project was designed partly to
   proselytize for RMS's position that information is community property and
   all software source should be shared.  One of its slogans is <quote>Help
   stamp out software hoarding!</quote> Though this remains controversial
   (because it implicitly denies any right of designers to own, assign, and
   sell the results of their labors), many hackers who disagree with RMS have
   nevertheless cooperated to produce large amounts of high-quality software
   for free redistribution under the Free Software Foundation's imprimatur.

   <para> [obs.] A type of Internet service first floated around 1991 and
   obsolesced around 1995 by the World Wide Web. Gopher presents a menuing
   interface to a tree or graph of links; the links can be to documents,
   runnable programs, or other gopher menus arbitrarily far across the
   net.</para>

   <para>Some claim that the gopher software, which was originally developed
   at the University of Minnesota, was named after the Minnesota Gophers (a
   sports team).  Others claim the word derives from American slang <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>gofer</emphasis> (from <quote>go for</quote>, dialectal
   <quote>go fer</quote>), one whose job is to run and fetch things.  Finally,
   observe that gophers dig long tunnels, and the idea of tunneling through
   the net to find information was a defining metaphor for the developers.
   Probably all three things were true, but with the first two coming first
   and the gopher-tunnel metaphor serendipitously adding flavor and impetus to
   the project as it developed out of its concept stage.</para>

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historical note: At least one real machine actually had a grind crank
   &mdash; the R1, a research machine built toward the end of the days of the
   great vacuum tube computers, in 1959.  R1 (also known as &lsquo;The Rice
   Institute Computer&rsquo; (TRIC) and later as &lsquo;The Rice University
   Computer&rsquo; (TRUC)) had a single-step/free-run switch for use when
   debugging programs.  Since single-stepping through a large program was
   rather tedious, there was also a crank with a cam and gear arrangement that
   repeatedly pushed the single-step button.  This allowed one to
   &lsquo;crank&rsquo; through a lot of code, then slow down to single-step
   for a bit when you got near the code of interest, poke at some registers
   using the console typewriter, and then keep on cranking.  See <ulink
   url='http://www.cs.rice.edu/History/R1/'>http://www.cs.rice.edu/History/R1/</ulink>.</para>

   <!-- More history: By 1969, the grind crank had gone
   electronic.  If you were running a compute-bound job from a TSS/360
   terminal, it eventually went into the low-priority queue, where it
   would stay nearly forever.  If you interrupted it with the
   &lsquo;attention&rsquo; key, the system would prompt for an action, such as
   "abort, continue", to which you could type "C".  However, the
   scheduler noted that the job had gone interactive, and would pop it
   to the top of the priority list, from which it would gradually
   decay back to the bottom of the queue.  Judicious use of this
   technique could speed one's job considerably, even with the several
   seconds of interaction which took place on each key hit. -->

   <para> [from archaic English verb for <emphasis

   in the game <glossterm>Zork</glossterm> (Dave Lebling took the name from
   Jack Vance's <citetitle>Dying Earth</citetitle> fantasies) and used in
   several other <glossterm>Infocom</glossterm> games as a hint that you
   should perhaps look for a lamp, torch or some type of light source.
   Wandering into a dark area would cause the game to prompt you, <quote>It is
   very dark.  If you continue you are likely to be eaten by a grue.</quote>
   If you failed to locate a light source within the next couple of moves this
   would indeed be the case.</para>

   <para>The grue, according to scholars of the Great Underground Empire, is a
   sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth.  Its favorite
   diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is
   tempered by its extreme fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by the
   light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground
   lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few have survived their fearsome jaws
   to tell the tale. Grues have sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed faces, sharp
   claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They
   are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are
   touchy is a dangerous understatement. <quote>Sour as a grue</quote> is a
   common expression, even among grues themselves.</para>

   solution while sitting cross-legged on a Joyboard trying to keep the board
   in balance.  This position resembled that of a meditating guru.  Sadly, the

   i.e., calling attention to the fact that they are being used in a
   nonstandard, ironic, or humorous way.  Originated in the fannish
   catchphrase <quote>Bheer is the One True Ghod!</quote> from decades ago.
   H-infix marking of &lsquo;Ghod&rsquo; and other words spread into the 1960s
   counterculture via underground comix, and into early hackerdom either from
   the counterculture or from SF fandom (the three overlapped heavily at the
   time).  More recently, the h infix has become an expected feature of
   benchmark names (Dhrystone, Rhealstone, etc.); this is probably patterning
   on the original Whetstone (the name of a laboratory) but influenced by the
   fannish/counterculture h infix.</para>

   <para> [from SF fandom, orig. as mutation of HHOK, &lsquo;Ha Ha Only
   Kidding&rsquo;] A phrase (often seen abbreviated as HHOS) that aptly
   captures the flavor of much hacker discourse.  Applied especially to
   parodies, absurdities, and ironic jokes that are both intended and
   perceived to contain a possibly disquieting amount of truth, or truths that
   are constructed on in-joke and self-parody.  This lexicon contains many
   examples of ha-ha-only-serious in both form and content.  Indeed, the
   entirety of hacker culture is often perceived as ha-ha-only-serious by
   hackers themselves; to take it either too lightly or too seriously marks a
   person as an outsider, a <glossterm>wannabee</glossterm>, or in
   <glossterm>larval stage</glossterm>.  For further enlightenment on this

   <para>Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer
   unaware of the high value placed on hack mode.  For example, if someone
   appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without
   turning one's eyes away from the screen) to avoid being interrupted.  One
   may read, type, and interact with the computer for quite some time before
   further acknowledging the other's presence (of course, he or she is
   reciprocally free to leave without a word).  The understanding is that you
   might be in <glossterm>hack mode</glossterm> with a lot of delicate
   <glossterm>state</glossterm> (sense 2) in your head, and you dare not

   <para>The term &lsquo;hacker&rsquo; also tends to connote membership in the

   <para>It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe

</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
   means universally, accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the
   hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away
   open-source software.  A few go further and assert that
   <emphasis>all</emphasis> information should be free and
   <emphasis>any</emphasis> proprietary control of it is bad; this is the
   philosophy behind the <glossterm>GNU</glossterm> project.</para>

   <para>Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
   cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.  But the
   belief that &lsquo;ethical&rsquo; cracking excludes destruction at least
   moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as &lsquo;benign&rsquo;
   crackers (see also <glossterm>samurai</glossterm>, <glossterm>gray
   hat</glossterm>).  On this view, it may be one of the highest forms of
   hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the
   sysop, preferably by email from a <glossterm>superuser</glossterm> account,
   exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged &mdash; acting as
   an unpaid (and unsolicited) <glossterm>tiger team</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic
   is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks,
   software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers.
   Huge cooperative networks such as <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>FidoNet</glossterm> and the Internet itself can function without
   central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a
   sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible
   asset.</para>

   having to do with confusion of metalevels (see

   documents, language descriptions (see <glossterm>INTERCAL</glossterm>), and
   even entire scientific theories (see

   <para>3. Jokes that involve screwily precise reasoning from bizarre,
   ludicrous, or just grossly counter-intuitive premises.</para>

   <para>4. Fascination with puns and wordplay.</para>

   <para>5. A fondness for apparently mindless humor with subversive currents
   of intelligence in it &mdash; for example, old Warner Brothers and Rocky
   &amp; Bullwinkle cartoons, the Marx brothers, the early B-52s, and Monty
   Python's Flying Circus.  Humor that combines this trait with elements of
   high camp and slapstick is especially favored.</para>

   <para>There is a theorem in simplicial homology theory which states that

   <para>The adjective &lsquo;long-haired&rsquo; is well-attested to have been

   &lsquo;long-hair&rsquo; was at the time used to describe a person

   was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s counterculture, leaving

   <para> MIT AI Memo 239 (February 1972).  A legendary collection of neat
   mathematical and programming hacks contributed by many people at MIT and
   elsewhere.  (The title of the memo really is <quote>HAKMEM</quote>, which
   is a 6-letterism for &lsquo;hacks memo&rsquo;.)  Some of them are very
   useful techniques, powerful theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but
   most fall into the category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a
   sampling of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:</para>

   <para>Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less
   than
   <literal>2<superscript>18</superscript></literal>.</para>

   <para>Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most <emphasis>probable</emphasis>
   suit distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3, which
   is the most <emphasis>evenly</emphasis> distributed.  This is because the
   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying things
   will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest
   disordered energy.</para>

   <para>Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5 (that
   is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25 such that all
   rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number).  There are about
   320 million, not counting those that differ only by rotation and
   reflection.</para>

   <para>Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming language
   is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of
   2.  If the result loops with period <literal>= 1</literal>
   with sign <literal>+</literal>, you are on a sign-magnitude
   machine.  If the result loops with period <literal>=
   1</literal> at <literal>-1</literal>, you are on a
   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1,
   including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement machine.  If the
   result loops with period greater than 1, not including the beginning, your
   machine isn't binary &mdash; the pattern should tell you the base.  If you
   run out of memory, you are on a string or bignum system.  If arithmetic
   overflow is a fatal error, some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying
   to enforce machine independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is
   machine dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more
   precisely, algebra: Let <literal>X =</literal> the sum of
   many powers of 2 = &ellipsis;111111 (base 2).  Now add
   <literal>X</literal> to itself: <literal>X + X
   =</literal> &ellipsis;111110.  Thus, <literal>2X = X -
   1</literal>, so <literal>X = -1</literal>.  Therefore
   algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is two's-complement.</para>

   <para>Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only
   number such that if you represent it on the <glossterm>PDP-10</glossterm>
   as both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
   representations are identical.</para>

   <para>Item 176 (Gosper): The <quote>banana phenomenon</quote> was
   encountered when processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters
   typed out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the text,
   taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating.
   This ensures that every 4-letter string output occurs in the original.  The
   program typed BANANANANANANANA&endellipsis; We note an ambiguity in the
   phrase, <quote>the <literal>N</literal>th occurrence
   of.</quote> In one sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another,
   there are nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only
   the first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By Murphy's
   Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a loop.  An option to
   find overlapped instances would be useful, although it would require
   backing up <literal>N</literal> &minus; 1 characters before
   seeking the next <literal>N</literal>-character
   string.</para>

   <para>Note: This last item refers to a 
   <glossterm>Dissociated Press</glossterm> implementation.  See also 
   <glossterm>banana problem</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
   technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> A shorthand method of spelling found on many British academic
   bulletin boards and <glossterm>talker system</glossterm>s.  Syllables and
   whole words in a sentence are replaced by single ASCII characters the names
   of which are phonetically similar or equivalent, while multiple letters are
   usually dropped.  Hence, &lsquo;for&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;4&rsquo;;
   &lsquo;two&rsquo;, &lsquo;too&rsquo;, and &lsquo;to&rsquo; become
   &lsquo;2&rsquo;; &lsquo;ck&rsquo; becomes &lsquo;k&rsquo;.  <quote>Before I
   see you tomorrow</quote> becomes <quote>b4 i c u 2moro</quote>.  First
   appeared in London about 1986, and was probably caused by the slowness of
   available talker systems, which operated on archaic machines with outdated
   operating systems and no standard methods of communication.</para>

   <para>Hakspek almost disappeared after the great bandwidth explosion of the
   early 1990s, as fast Internet links wiped out the old-style talker systems.
   However, it has enjoyed a revival in another medium &mdash; the Short Message
   Service (SMS) associated with GSM cellphones.  SMS sends are limited to a
   maximum of 160 characters, and typing on a cellphone keypad is difficult
   and slow anyway.  There are now even published paper dictionaries for SMS
   users to help them do hakspek-to-English and vice-versa.</para>

   paraphrase of someone else's argument suggests that it is a handwave).  The
   theory behind this term is that if you wave your hands at the right moment,
   the listener may be sufficiently distracted to not notice that what you
   have said is <glossterm>bogus</glossterm>.  Failing that, if a listener
   does object, you might try to dismiss the objection with a wave of your

   <para>The use of this word is often accompanied by gestures: both hands up,
   palms forward, swinging the hands in a vertical plane pivoting at the
   elbows and/or shoulders (depending on the magnitude of the handwave);
   alternatively, holding the forearms in one position while rotating the
   hands at the wrist to make them flutter.  In context, the gestures alone
   can suffice as a remark; if a speaker makes an outrageously unsupported
   assumption, you might simply wave your hands in this way, as an accusation,
   far more eloquent than words could express, that his logic is

   <para> Of software, used to emphasize that a program is unaware of some

   like to be angry at it but we shouldn't, we should try to understand it
   instead. The adjective <quote>cheerfully</quote> is often used in exactly

   <para>Actually, neither term is etymologically pure.  If we take <emphasis

   &lsquo;denary&rsquo;, which comes from &lsquo;deni&rsquo; (ten at a time,
   ten each), a Latin <emphasis role='firstterm'>distributive</emphasis>
   number; the corresponding term for base-16 would be something like
   &lsquo;sendenary&rsquo;.  <quote>Decimal</quote> comes from the combining
   root of <emphasis role='firstterm'>decem</emphasis>, Latin for 10. If wish
   to create a truly analogous word for base 16, we should start with
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>sedecim</emphasis>, Latin for 16. Ergo,
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>sedecimal</emphasis> is the word that would have
   been created by a Latin scholar.  The &lsquo;sexa-&rsquo; prefix is Latin
   but incorrect in this context, and
   <wordasword>&lsquo;hexa-</wordasword>&rsquo; is Greek.  The word <emphasis

   would be &lsquo;octaval&rsquo; (to go with decimal), or
   &lsquo;octonary&rsquo; (to go with binary).  If anyone ever implements a

   files with holes so that unused regions of the file are never actually
   stored on disk.  (In techspeak, these are referred to as
   &lsquo;sparse&rsquo; files.)  As another example, the region of memory in
   IBM PCs reserved for memory-mapped I/O devices which may not actually be
   present is called &lsquo;the I/O hole&rsquo;, since memory-management
   systems must skip over this area when filling user requests for
   memory.</para>

   <para> [Usenet: <systemitem role='newsgroup'>sci.space</systemitem>] To be
   hollised is to have been ordered by one's employer not to post any even
   remotely job-related material to Usenet (or, by extension, to other
   Internet media).  The original and most notorious case of this involved one
   Ken Hollis, a Lockheed employee and space-program enthusiast who posted
   publicly available material on access to Space Shuttle launches to
   <systemitem role='newsgroup'>sci.space</systemitem>.  He was gagged under
   threat of being fired in 1994 at the behest of NASA public-relations
   officers. The result was, of course, a huge publicity black eye for NASA.
   Nevertheless several other NASA contractor employees were subsequently
   hollised for similar activities.  Use of this term carries the strong
   connotation that the persons doing the gagging are bureaucratic idiots
   blinded to their own best interests by territorial reflexes.</para>

   characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical disputes
   is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time trying to
   pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as objective
   technical evaluations.  This happens precisely because in a true holy war,
   the actual substantive differences between the sides are relatively minor.

   <para> A software or hardware feature included in order to simplify later
   additions or changes by a user.  For example, a simple program that prints
   numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible version
   would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5
   would make the program print numbers in base 5.  The variable is a simple
   hook.  An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a
   value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the
   address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number.  This is a
   <glossterm>hairy</glossterm> but powerful hook; one can then write a
   routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters,
   and plug it into the program through the hook.  Often the difference
   between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks
   in judiciously chosen places.  Both may do the original job about equally
   well, but the one with the hooks is much more flexible for future expansion
   of capabilities (<glossterm>EMACS</glossterm>, for example, is
   <emphasis>all</emphasis> hooks).  The term <emphasis role='firstterm'>user

   <para> 1. [primarily used by C/Unix programmers, but spreading] It is
   received wisdom that in most programs, less than 10% of the code eats 90%
   of the execution time; if one were to graph instruction visits versus code
   addresses, one would typically see a few huge spikes amidst a lot of
   low-level noise.  Such spikes are called <emphasis role='firstterm'>hot
   spots</emphasis> and are good candidates for heavy optimization or
   <glossterm>hand-hacking</glossterm>.  The term is especially used of tight
   loops and recursions in the code's central algorithm, as opposed to (say)
   initial set-up costs or large but infrequent I/O operations.  See

   <para> Once upon a time, the computer company most hackers loved to hate;
   today, the one they are most puzzled to find themselves liking.</para>

   <para>From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM
   was regarded with active loathing.  Common expansions of the corporate name
   included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black
   Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a
   near-<glossterm>infinite</glossterm> number of even less complimentary
   expansions (see also <glossterm>fear and loathing</glossterm>).  What
   galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much
   that they were underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against
   them), but that the designs were incredibly archaic,
   <glossterm>crufty</glossterm>, and <glossterm>elephantine</glossterm>
   &ellipsis; and you couldn't <emphasis>fix</emphasis> them &mdash; source
   code was locked up tight, and programming tools were expensive, hard to
   find, and bletcherous to use once you had found them.</para>

   <para>We didn't know how good we had it back then.  In the 1980s IBM had
   its own troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from
   the hacker community's view.  Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more
   noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever been.</para>

   <para>In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began
   to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began
   shipping <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> systems and building ties to the
   Linux community.  To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a
   staunch friend of the hacker community and 
   <glossterm>open source</glossterm> development, with ironic consequences
   noted in the <glossterm>FUD</glossterm> entry.</para>

   <para>This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to
   &lsquo;IBM&rsquo;; these derive from some rampantly unofficial jargon lists
   circulated within IBM's formerly beleaguered hacker underground.</para>

   ground in 1980--81, it has grown exponentially, approximately doubling in
   size every year.  On the other hand, most people feel the
   <glossterm>signal-to-noise ratio</glossterm> of Usenet has dropped
   steadily.  These trends led, as far back as mid-1983, to predictions of the
   imminent collapse (or death) of the net.  Ten years and numerous doublings
   later, enough of these gloomy prognostications have been confounded that
   the phrase <quote>Imminent Death Of The Net Predicted!</quote> has become a
   running joke, hauled out any time someone grumbles about the 
   <glossterm>S/N ratio</glossterm> or the huge and steadily increasing volume, or the
   possible loss of a key node or link, or the potential for lawsuits when
   ignoramuses post copyrighted material, etc., etc., etc.</para>

   <para> [C, C++, and Java programmers] The rules one uses to indent code in
   a readable fashion.  There are four major C indent styles, described below;
   all have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track the
   scope of control constructs.  They have been inherited by C++ and Java,
   which have C-like syntaxes.  The significant variable is the placement of
   <literal>{</literal> and <literal>}</literal> with respect to the
   statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or controlling statement
   (<command remap='code'>if</command>, <command remap='code'>else</command>,
   <command remap='code'>for</command>, <command remap='code'>while</command>,
   or <command remap='code'>do</command>) on the block, if any.</para>

   <para><emphasis role='firstterm'>K&amp;R style</emphasis> &mdash; Named
   after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because the examples in <glossterm
   linkend='K-ampersand-R'>K&amp;R</glossterm> are formatted this way.  Also
   called <emphasis role='firstterm'>kernel style</emphasis> because the Unix
   kernel is written in it, and the &lsquo;One True Brace Style&rsquo;
   (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  In C code, the body is typically indented
   by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are
   occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four tends to be the rule
   rather than the exception.</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
if (&lt;cond&gt;) {
        &lt;body&gt;
}
</literallayout>

   <para><emphasis role='firstterm'>Allman style</emphasis> &mdash; Named for
   Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it
   (it is sometimes called <emphasis role='firstterm'>BSD style</emphasis>).
   Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol.  It is the only style
   other than K&amp;R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent
   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces
   are generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)
{
        &lt;body&gt;
}
</literallayout>

   <para><emphasis role='firstterm'>Whitesmiths style</emphasis> &mdash;
   popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early
   commercial C compiler.  Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces,
   but four spaces are occasionally seen.</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)
        {
        &lt;body&gt;
        }
</literallayout>

   <para><emphasis role='firstterm'>GNU style</emphasis> &mdash; Used
   throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation code, and just about
   nowhere else.  Indents are always four spaces per level, with <command
   remap='code'>{</command> and <command remap='code'>}</command> halfway
   between the outer and inner indent levels.</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)
  {
    &lt;body&gt;
  }
</literallayout>

   <para>Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&amp;R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to get
   lost against the right paren of the guard part in an <command
   remap='code'>if</command> or <command remap='code'>while</command>, which
   is a <glossterm>Bad Thing</glossterm>).  Defenders of 1TBS argue that any
   putative gain in readability is less important than their style's relative
   economy with vertical space, which enables one to see more code on one's
   screen at once.  The Java Language Specification legislates not only the
   capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns, adjectives, and verbs
   should be in method, class, interface, and variable names (section
   6.8). While the specification stops short of also standardizing on a
   bracing style, all source code originating from Sun Laboratories uses the
   K&amp;R style.  This has set a precedent for Java programmers, which most
   follow.</para>

   <para>Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of
   <glossterm>holy wars</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> It is common lore among hackers (and in the electronics industry at
   large; this term is possibly techspeak by now) that the chances of sudden
   hardware failure drop off exponentially with a machine's time since first
   use (that is, until the relatively distant time at which enough mechanical
   wear in I/O devices and thermal-cycling stress in components has
   accumulated for the machine to start going senile).  Up to half of all chip
   and wire failures happen within a new system's first few weeks; such
   failures are often referred to as <emphasis role='firstterm'>infant

   <para>Other hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be

   <para>In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually
   put a working computer in a cage with six crested macaques.  The monkeys
   proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the
   letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in).  The
   results were published in a limited-edition book, <citetitle>Notes Towards
   The Complete Works of Shakespeare</citetitle>. A researcher reported:
   <quote>They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when
   they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention
   there.</quote> Scattered field reports that there are AOL users this
   competent have been greeted with well-deserved skepticism.</para>

   <para>This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn &Eacute;mile
   Borel in 1913, and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short
   story <ulink url="http://www.janda.org/c10/readings/monkeys.htm">Inflexible
   Logic</ulink> by Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through
   a reference in Douglas Adams's <citetitle>Hitchhiker's Guide to the

   <para> [said by the authors to stand for <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>Compiler Language With No Pronounceable
   Acronym</emphasis>] A computer language designed by Don Woods and James
   Lyons in 1972.  INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer
   languages in all ways but one; it is purely a written language, being
   totally unspeakable.  An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will
   make the style of the language clear:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'>
<para>It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is
incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if one were to state
that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable
is:</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
DO :1 &lt;- #0$#256
</literallayout>

<para>any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this is
indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish in
front of his boss, who would of course have happened to turn up, as bosses are
wont to do.  The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer having
been correct.</para>
</blockquote>

   <para>INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many
   (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language has been
   recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an
   unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an <systemitem
   role='newsgroup'>alt.lang.intercal</systemitem> newsgroup devoted to the
   study and &ellipsis; appreciation of the language on Usenet.</para>

   <para>Inevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web: <ulink
   url='&esrhome;/intercal/'>&esrhome;/intercal/</ulink>. An
   extended version, implemented in (what else?)  <glossterm>Perl</glossterm>
   and adding object-oriented features, is rumored to exist.  See also

</revision>
</revhistory>
<glossdef>
   <para> The mother of all networks.  First incarnated beginning in 1969 as
   the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed.  Though it has
   been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture
   for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and
   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was conceived from
   the start as a way to get most economical use out of then-scarce
   large-computer resources.  Robert Herzfeld, who was director of ARPA at 
   the time, has been at some pains to debunk the 
   <quote>survive-a-nuclear-war</quote> myth, but it seems unkillable.</para>

   <para>As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to
   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of
   distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail quickly
   grew to dominate actual usage.  Universities, research labs and defense
   contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of
   communication between <emphasis>humans</emphasis> and linked up in steadily
   increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies,
   hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie
   in those early years.</para>

   <para>Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The
   typical machine/OS combination moved from <glossterm>DEC</glossterm>
   <glossterm>PDP-10</glossterm>s and <glossterm>PDP-20</glossterm>s, running
   <glossterm>TOPS-10</glossterm> and <glossterm>TOPS-20</glossterm>, to
   PDP-11s and <glossterm>VAX</glossterm>en and Suns running
   <glossterm>Unix</glossterm>, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel
   microcomputers.  The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably
   in the move from NCP/IP to <glossterm>TCP/IP</glossterm> in 1982 and the
   implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983.  It was around this time
   that people began referring to the collection of interconnected networks
   with ARPANET at its core as <quote>the Internet</quote>.</para>

   <para>The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --
   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research
   project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join
   didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National Science Foundation built
   NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers;
   NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original ARPANET
   pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994
   the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until
   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.</para>

   <para>That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered
   the Internet.  Once again, the <glossterm>killer app</glossterm> was not
   the anticipated one &mdash; rather, what caught the public imagination was
   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.  Subsequently
   the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the OSI protocol
   stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and is in the process of
   absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks built during the
   second wave of wide-area networking after 1980.  By 1996 it had become a
   commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a globally-extended
   Internet would become the key unifying communications technology of the
   next century. See also <glossterm>the network</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> 1. Incompatible Time-sharing System, an influential though highly
   idiosyncratic operating system written for PDP-6s and PDP-10s at MIT and
   long used at the MIT AI Lab.  Much AI-hacker jargon derives from ITS
   folklore, and to have been &lsquo;an ITS hacker&rsquo; qualifies one
   instantly as an old-timer of the most venerable sort.  ITS pioneered many
   important innovations, including transparent file sharing between machines
   and terminal-independent I/O.  After about 1982, most actual work was
   shifted to newer machines, with the remaining ITS boxes run essentially as
   a hobby and service to the hacker community.  The shutdown of the lab's
   last ITS machine in May 1990 marked the end of an era and sent old-time
   hackers into mourning nationwide (see 
   <glossterm>high moby</glossterm>).  There is an <ulink

   <para> 2. A mythical image of operating-system perfection worshiped by a
   bizarre, fervent retro-cult of old-time hackers and ex-users (see
   <glossterm>troglodyte</glossterm>, sense 2).  ITS worshipers manage somehow
   to continue believing that an OS maintained by assembly-language
   hand-hacking that supported only monocase 6-character filenames in one
   directory per account remains superior to today's state of commercial art
   (their venom against <glossterm>Unix</glossterm> is particularly intense).

   <para> An object-oriented language originally developed at Sun by James
   Gosling (and known by the name <quote>Oak</quote>) with the intention of
   being the successor to <glossterm>C++</glossterm> (the project was however
   originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes).
   After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a
   byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype
   campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for
   distributed applications.</para>

   <para>Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been
   embraced by many in the hacker community &mdash; but it has been a
   considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from
   uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and
   some notorious deficiencies in some of the standard toolkits (AWT in
   particular).  <glossterm>Microsoft</glossterm>'s determined attempts to
   corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly)
   have not helped.  As of 2003, these issues are still in the process of
   being resolved.</para>

   <para>Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult
   to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a
   complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet,
   and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the
   limelight the way Java has).  On the other hand, Java has already been a
   big <glossterm>win</glossterm> in academic circles, where it has taken the
   place of <glossterm>Pascal</glossterm> as the preferred tool for teaching
   the basics of good programming to the next generation of hackers.</para>

   <para> 1. IBM's supremely <glossterm>rude</glossterm> Job Control Language.
   JCL is the script language used to control the execution of programs in
   IBM's batch systems.  JCL has a very <glossterm>fascist</glossterm> syntax,
   and some versions will, for example, <glossterm>barf</glossterm> if two
   spaces appear where it expects one.  Most programmers confronted with JCL
   simply copy a working file (or card deck), changing the file names.
   Someone who actually understands and generates unique JCL is regarded with
   the mixed respect one gives to someone who memorizes the phone book.  It is
   reported that hackers at IBM itself sometimes sing <quote>Who's the breeder
   of the crud that mangles you and me?  I-B-M, J-C-L, M-o-u-s-e</quote> to

   <para>The popularity of the phrase &lsquo;attack of the killer

   <citetitle>Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes</citetitle> (one of the
   <glossterm>canonical</glossterm> examples of so-bad-it's-wonderful among

   <para>[2002 update: Eugene Brooks was right.  Since this term first entered
   the Jargon File in 1990, the minicomputer has effectively vanished, the
   <glossterm>mainframe</glossterm> sector is in deep and apparently terminal

   <para>This word appears to have derived from Scots <emphasis

   military slang.  It apparently became confused with

   Britons from that era use both words in definably different ways, but
   <glossterm>kluge</glossterm> is now uncommon in Great Britain.
   &lsquo;Kludge&rsquo; in Commonwealth hackish differs in meaning from
   &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; in that it lacks the positive senses; a kludge is
   something no Commonwealth hacker wants to be associated too closely with.
   Also, &lsquo;kludge&rsquo; is more widely known in British mainstream slang
   than &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; is in the U.S.</para>

</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Nowadays this term is often encountered in the variant spelling
   &lsquo;kludge&rsquo;.  Reports from <glossterm>old fart</glossterm>s are
   consistent that &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; was the original spelling, reported
   around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used
   exclusively of <emphasis>hardware</emphasis> kluges.  In 1947, the
   <citetitle>New York Folklore Quarterly</citetitle> reported a classic
   shaggy-dog story &lsquo;Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker&rsquo; then current in
   the Armed Forces, in which a &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; was a complex and puzzling
   artifact with a trivial function.  Other sources report that
   &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of
   electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at
   sea.</para>

   <para>However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device
   called a <quote>Kluge paper feeder</quote>, an adjunct to mechanical
   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before
   small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a
   fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power
   and synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft.  It was
   accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly
   difficult to repair &mdash; but oh, so clever!  People who tell this story
   also aver that &lsquo;Kluge&rsquo; was the name of a design
   engineer.</para>

   <para>There is in fact a Brandtjen &amp; Kluge Inc., an old family business
   that manufactures printing equipment &mdash; interestingly, their name is
   pronounced <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/kloo&acute;gee/</emphasis>!
   Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his
   company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named Kluge <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/kloo&acute;gee/</emphasis>, who built and co-designed
   the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919.  Mr. Brandtjen claims,
   however, that this was a <emphasis>simple</emphasis> device (with only four
   cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its complexity took hold.
   Other correspondents differ with Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and
   his allegation that it was a simple rather than complex one, but agree that
   the Kluge automatic feeder was the most likely source of the
   folklore.</para>

   <para><glossterm>TMRC</glossterm> and the MIT hacker culture of the early
   '60s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used
   some WWII military slang (see also <glossterm>foobar</glossterm>).  It
   seems likely that &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; came to MIT via alumni of the many
   military electronics projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in
   MIT's venerable Building 20, in which <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm> is also
   located) during the war.</para>

   <para>The variant &lsquo;kludge&rsquo; was apparently popularized by the
   <glossterm>Datamation</glossterm> article mentioned under
   <glossterm>kludge</glossterm>; it was titled <citetitle>How to Design a
   Kludge</citetitle> (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was probably
   imported from Great Britain, where <glossterm>kludge</glossterm> has an
   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on
   either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group
   <systemitem role='newsgroup'>alt.folklore.computers</systemitem> over the
   First and Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think
   <glossterm>kludge</glossterm> was just a mutation of
   <glossterm>kluge</glossterm>).  It now appears that the British, having
   forgotten the etymology of their own &lsquo;kludge&rsquo; when
   &lsquo;kluge&rsquo; crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the
   &lsquo;kludge&rsquo; orthography in the other direction and confusing their
   American cousins' spelling!</para>

   <para>The result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers
   pronounce the word as <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/klooj/</emphasis> but
   spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as
   &lsquo;kludge&rsquo;. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, centrifuge, and
   deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.  Whatever its
   failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly consistent about
   this distinction.)  British hackers mostly learned <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/kluhj/</emphasis> orally, use it in a restricted
   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have mostly
   learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it
   <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/kluhj/</emphasis> but use the wider
   American meaning!</para>

   <para>Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
   meaning.</para>

   <para> [from a kid's sugar-enriched drink in fruity flavors] When someone
   who should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually begins

   have drunk the Kool-Aid.  Usually the decortication process is slow and
   almost unnoticeable until one day the victim emerges as a True Believer and
   begins spreading the faith himself.  The term originates in the suicide of
   914 followers of Jim Jones's People's Temple cult in Guyana in 1978 (there
   are also resonances with Ken Kesey's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Tests from the
   1960s).  What the Jonestown victims actually drank was cyanide-laced

   <para>This has live variants.  When a suit is blithering on about their
   latest technology and how it will save the world, that's &lsquo;pouring
   Kool-Aid&rsquo;. When the suit does not violate the laws of physics,
   doesn't make impossible claims, and in fact says something reasonable and
   believable, that's pouring good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence
   <quote>He pours good Kool-Aid, doesn't he?</quote> This connotes that the

   <para> [from the then-large number of <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm>
   <glossterm>VAXen</glossterm> with names of the form <systemitem
   role='hostname'>foovax</systemitem>] Originally, a fictitious Usenet site
   at the Kremlin, announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly
   originated there by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The <ulink url='
   http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=0001%40kremvax.UUCP'> posting</ulink>
   was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other
   fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were <systemitem
   role='hostname'>moskvax</systemitem> and <glossterm>kgbvax</glossterm>.
   This was probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries
   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them), because
   the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so
   totally absurd at the time.</para>

   <para>In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
   Moscow, <systemitem role='hostname'>demos.su</systemitem>, joined Usenet.
   Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it weren't just
   another prank.  Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major
   poster from there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to
   it frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some credulous
   readers by blandly asserting that he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a
   hoax!</para>
<!-- from Mark S. Brader <msb@vex.net>, 07 Dec 1990 -->

   <para>Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named
   <systemitem role='hostname'>kremvax</systemitem>, thus neatly turning
   fiction into fact and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor
   transcends cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the
   Russian-language material for this lexicon. &mdash;ESR]</para>

   <para>In an even more ironic historical footnote, <systemitem
   role='hostname'>kremvax</systemitem> became an electronic center of the
   anti-communist resistance during the bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.
   During those three days the Soviet UUCP network centered on <systemitem
   role='hostname'>kremvax</systemitem> became the only trustworthy news
   source for many places within the USSR.  Though the sysops were
   concentrating on internal communications, cross-border postings included
   immediate transliterations of Boris Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup
   and eyewitness reports of the demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those
   hours, years of speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to
   maintain its grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer
   networking were proved devastatingly accurate &mdash; and the original
   <systemitem role='hostname'>kremvax</systemitem> joke became a reality as
   Yeltsin and the new Russian revolutionaries of <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>glasnost</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>perestroika</emphasis> made <systemitem
   role='hostname'>kremvax</systemitem> one of the timeliest means of their
   outreach to the West.</para>

   try to upload garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in this
   context is read as a few years to anything older than 3 days).
   &lsquo;Lamer&rsquo; is also much used in the IRC world in a similar sense

   <para> 1. A cellular-automata game invented by John Horton Conway
   and first introduced publicly by Martin Gardner
   (<citetitle>Scientific American</citetitle>, October 1970); the
   game's popularity had to wait a few years for computers on which it
   could reasonably be played, as it's no fun to simulate the cells by
   hand.  Many hackers pass through a stage of fascination with it,
   and hackers at various places contributed heavily to the
   mathematical analysis of this game (most notably Bill Gosper at
   MIT, who even implemented life in <glossterm>TECO</glossterm>!).
   When a hacker mentions &lsquo;life&rsquo;, he is much more likely
   to mean this game than the magazine, the breakfast cereal, or the
   human state of existence.  Many web resources are
   available starting from the <ulink
   url='http://dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/'>Open
   Directory page of Life</ulink>. The <ulink
   url='http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm'>Life

   included a dummy line of <emphasis role='firstterm'>line eater

   <para> The free Unix workalike created by Linus Torvalds and friends
   starting about 1991. The pronunciation <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/li&acute;nuhks/</emphasis> is preferred because the
   name &lsquo;Linus&rsquo; has an <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/ee/</emphasis> sound in Swedish (Linus's family is
   part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English
   short <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/i/</emphasis> to be closer to
   <emphasis role='pronunciation'>/ee/</emphasis> than English long <emphasis
   role='pronunciation'>/i:/</emphasis>.  This may be the most remarkable
   hacker project in history &mdash; an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and
   Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to
   Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use).</para>

   <para>Linux is what <glossterm>GNU</glossterm> aimed to be, and it relies
   on the GNU toolset.  But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the
   kernel to go with that toolset until 1999, which was too late.  Other,
   similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful
   but never caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2003, Linux
   has effectively swallowed all proprietary Unixes except Solaris and is
   seriously challenging Microsoft. It has already captured 41% of the
   Internet-server market and over 25% of general business servers.</para>

   <para>An earlier version of this entry opined <quote>The secret of Linux's
   success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the
   development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball
   effect.</quote> Truer than we knew.  See
   <glossterm>bazaar</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>(Some people object that the name &lsquo;Linux&rsquo; should be used
   to refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system.  This claim
   is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the
   term <emphasis role='firstterm'>GNU/Linux</emphasis> want the
   <glossterm>FSF</glossterm> to get most of the credit for Linux because RMS
   and friends wrote many of its user-level tools.  Neither this theory nor
   the term <emphasis role='firstterm'>GNU/Linux</emphasis> has gained more
   than minority acceptance).</para>

   <para> [from &lsquo;LISt Processing language&rsquo;, but mythically from
   &lsquo;Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses&rsquo;] AI's mother
   tongue, a language based on the ideas of (a) variable-length lists and
   trees as fundamental data types, and (b) the interpretation of code as data
   and vice-versa.  Invented by John McCarthy at MIT in the late 1950s, it is
   actually older than any other <glossterm>HLL</glossterm> still in use
   except FORTRAN.  Accordingly, it has undergone considerable adaptive
   radiation over the years; modern variants are quite different in detail
   from the original LISP 1.5.  The dominant HLL among hackers until the early
   1980s, LISP has since shared the throne with <glossterm>C</glossterm>.  Its
   partisans claim it is the only language that is truly beautiful.  See
   <glossterm>languages of choice</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>All LISP functions and programs are expressions that return values;
   this, together with the high memory utilization of LISPs, gave rise to Alan
   Perlis's famous quip (itself a take on an Oscar Wilde quote) that
   <quote>LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of
   nothing</quote>.</para>

   <para>One significant application for LISP has been as a proof by example
   that most newer languages, such as <glossterm>COBOL</glossterm> and
   Ada, are full of unnecessary
   <glossterm>crock</glossterm>s.  When the <glossterm>Right Thing</glossterm>

   <para>At Stanford, &lsquo;logical&rsquo; compass directions denote a
   coordinate system relative to El Camino Real, in which &lsquo;logical
   north&rsquo; is always toward San Francisco and &lsquo;logical south&rsquo;
   is always toward San Jose--in spite of the fact that El Camino Real runs
   physical north/south near San Francisco, physical east/west near San Jose,
   and along a curve everywhere in between. (The best rule of thumb here is
   that, by definition, El Camino Real always runs logical
   north-south.)</para>

   <para>In giving directions, one might say: <quote>To get to Rincon Tarasco
   restaurant, get onto <glossterm>El Camino Bignum</glossterm> going logical
   north.</quote> Using the word &lsquo;logical&rsquo; helps to prevent the
   recipient from worrying about that the fact that the sun is setting almost
   directly in front of him.  The concept is reinforced by North American
   highways which are almost, but not quite, consistently labeled with logical
   rather than physical directions.  A similar situation exists at MIT: Route
   128 (famous for the electronics industry that grew up along it) wraps
   roughly 3 quarters around Boston at a radius of 10 miles, terminating near
   the coastline at each end.  It would be most precise to describe the two
   directions along this highway as &lsquo;clockwise&rsquo; and
   &lsquo;counterclockwise&rsquo;, but the road signs all say
   <quote>north</quote> and <quote>south</quote>, respectively.  A hacker
   might describe these directions as <emphasis role='firstterm'>logical
   north</emphasis> and <emphasis role='firstterm'>logical south</emphasis>,
   to indicate that they are conventional directions not corresponding to the
   usual denotation for those words.</para>

   <glossterm>loser</glossterm> are pronounced identically.)  This word was
   coined around 1975 at MIT.  Under ITS, when you first walked up to a
   terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it
   printed out some status information, including how many people were already
   using the computer; it might print <quote>14 users</quote>, for example.
   Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print
   <quote>14 losers</quote> instead.  There ensued a great controversy, as
   some of the users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their
   faces every time they used the computer.  For a while several hackers
   struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the
   others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it
   would say <quote>users</quote> or <quote>losers</quote>.  Finally, someone
   tried the compromise <quote>lusers</quote>, and it stuck.  Later one of the
   ITS machines supported <command remap='code'>luser</command> as a
   request-for-help command.  ITS died the death in mid-1990, except as a
   museum piece; the usage lives on, however, and the term <emphasis

   <para> [techspeak] A name (possibly followed by a formal
   <glossterm>arg</glossterm> list) that is equated to a text or symbolic
   expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the substitution of
   actual arguments) by a macro expander.  This definition can be found in any
   technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the hackish
   connotations of the term have changed over time.</para>

   <para>The term <emphasis role='firstterm'>macro</emphasis> originated in
   early assemblers, which encouraged the use of macros as a structuring and
   information-hiding device.  During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became
   ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as
   <glossterm>HLL</glossterm>s, only to fall from favor as improving compiler
   technology marginalized assembler programming (see 
   <glossterm>languages of choice</glossterm>).  Nowadays the term is most often used in connection
   with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages
   built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff
   suite).</para>

   <para>Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>macros</emphasis> is now sometimes used for code in any
   special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language
   is actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such
   as the <emphasis role='firstterm'>keyboard macros</emphasis> supported in
   some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard
   enhancers).</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> 2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm

   <para> 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to
   indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and various
   applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of

   magic numbers were <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm> branch instructions that
   skipped over header data to the start of executable code; 0407, for
   example, was octal for &lsquo;branch 16 bytes relative&rsquo;.  Many other
   kinds of files now have magic numbers somewhere; some magic numbers are, in
   fact, strings, like the <literal>!&lt;arch&gt;</literal> at the beginning
   of a Unix archive file or the <literal>%!</literal> leading PostScript
   files.  Nowadays only a <glossterm>wizard</glossterm> knows the spells to

<glossdef>
   <para> 4. An input that leads to a computational boundary condition, where
   algorithm behavior becomes discontinuous.  Numeric overflows (particularly

   <para>Mailing lists are one of the primary forms of hacker interaction,
   along with <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm>.  They predate Usenet, having
   originated with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often
   used for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though some of
   these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the Internet
   Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   &lsquo;sf-lovers&rsquo; list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most infamous of the
   social lists was the eccentric <systemitem
   role='hostname'>bandykin</systemitem> distribution; its latter-day progeny,
   <systemitem role='hostname'>lectroids</systemitem> and <systemitem
   role='hostname'>tanstaafl</systemitem>, still include a number of the
   oddest and most interesting people in hackerdom.</para>

   <para>Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large, at
   which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail software).
   Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups, the members of
   which can then collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet
   face-to-face.  Much of the material in this lexicon was criticized and
   polished on just such a mailing list (called &lsquo;jargon-friends&rsquo;),
   which included all the co-authors of Steele-1983.</para>

   <para> Term originally referring to the cabinet containing the central
   processor unit or &lsquo;main frame&rsquo; of a room-filling
   <glossterm>Stone Age</glossterm> batch machine.  After the emergence of
   smaller <emphasis role='firstterm'>minicomputer</emphasis> designs in the
   early 1970s, the traditional <glossterm>big iron</glossterm> machines were
   described as &lsquo;mainframe computers&rsquo; and eventually just as
   mainframes.  The term carries the connotation of a machine designed for
   batch rather than interactive use, though possibly with an interactive
   timesharing operating system retrofitted onto it; it is especially used of
   machines built by IBM, Unisys, and the other great
   <glossterm>dinosaur</glossterm>s surviving from computing's
   <glossterm>Stone Age</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>It has been common wisdom among hackers since the late 1980s that the
   mainframe architectural tradition is essentially dead (outside of the tiny
   market for <glossterm>number-crunching</glossterm> supercomputers having
   been swamped by the recent huge advances in IC technology and low-cost
   personal computing.  The wave of failures, takeovers, and mergers among
   traditional mainframe makers in the early 1990s bore this out.  The biggest
   mainframer of all, IBM, was compelled to re-invent itself as a huge
   systems-consulting house.  (See <glossterm>dinosaurs mating</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>killer micro</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>However, in yet another instance of the 
   <glossterm>cycle of reincarnation</glossterm>, the port of Linux to the IBM S/390 architecture
   in 1999 &mdash; assisted by IBM &mdash; produced a resurgence of interest in mainframe
   computing as a way of providing huge quantities of easily maintainable,
   reliable virtual Linux servers, saving IBM's mainframe division from almost
   certain extinction.</para>

   <para>A page from the Unix Programmer's Manual,
   documenting one of Unix's many commands, system calls,
   library subroutines, device driver interfaces, file formats,
   games, macro packages, or maintenance utilities.
   By extension, the term <quote>man page</quote> may be used to refer to
   documentation of any kind, under any system, though it is most likely to be
   confined to short on-line references.</para>

   <para>As mentioned in <xref linkend='conventions'/>, there is a
   standard syntax for referring to man page entries: the phrase
   <quote>foo(n)</quote> refers to the page for <quote>foo</quote> in chapter
   n of the manual, where chapter 1 is user commands, chapter 2 is system
   calls, etc.</para>

   <para>The man page format is beloved, or berated, for having the same sort
   of pithy utility as the rest of Unix.  Man pages tend to be written as very
   compact, concise descriptions which are complete but not forgiving of the
   lazy or careless reader.  Their stylized format does a good job of
   summarizing the essentials: invocation syntax, options, basic
   functionality.  While such a concise reference is perfect for the
   do-one-thing-and-do-it-well tools which are favored by the Unix philosophy,
   it admittedly breaks down when applied to a command which is itself a major
   subsystem.</para>

   <para> A legendary tragic failure, the archetypal Hacker Dream Gone Wrong.
   Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by
   Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group): the multi-processor SC-30M, the small
   uniprocessor SC-25, and the never-built superprocessor SC-40.  These
   machines were marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than
   the unique <glossterm>Foonly</glossterm> F-1, they were physically smaller
   and consumed less power than the much slower <glossterm>DEC</glossterm>
   KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines.  They were also completely
   compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the
   operating system) with no modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a
   KL10.</para>

   <para>When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 (their followup to the
   PDP-10), Systems Concepts should have made a bundle selling their machine
   into shops with a lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their
   spring 1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the PDP-10
   world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of 1984, and TOPS-20
   by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers running Systems Concepts were
   much better at designing machines than at mass producing or selling them;
   the company allowed itself to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism
   into continually improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery
   dates continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and
   <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> 8600 and failed to reckon with the likes of Sun
   Microsystems and other hungry startups building workstations with power
   comparable to the KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped
   the first SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or Unix
   boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being purchased by
   CompuServe.</para>

   <para>This tale and the related saga of <glossterm>Foonly</glossterm> hold
   a lesson for hackers: if you want to play in the 
   <glossterm>Real World</glossterm>, you need to learn Real World moves.</para>

   discussion.  The word <glossterm>foo</glossterm> is the
   <glossterm>canonical</glossterm> example.  To avoid confusion, hackers
   never (well, hardly ever) use &lsquo;foo&rsquo; or other words like it as
   permanent names for anything.  In filenames, a common convention is that
   any filename beginning with a metasyntactic-variable name is a
   <glossterm>scratch</glossterm> file that may be deleted at any time.</para>

   <para>Metasyntactic variables are so called because (1) they are variables
   in the metalanguage used to talk about programs etc; (2) they are variables
   whose values are often variables (as in usages like <quote>the value of
   f(foo,bar) is the sum of foo and bar</quote>).  However, it has been
   plausibly suggested that the real reason for the term <quote>metasyntactic
   variable</quote> is that it sounds good.  To some extent, the list of one's
   preferred metasyntactic variables is a cultural signature.  They occur both
   in series (used for related groups of variables or objects) and as
   singletons.  Here are a few common signatures:</para>

   <para> 1. <emphasis role='grammar'>adj.</emphasis> Describes a talk on a
   programming language design that is heavy on the syntax (with lots of BNF),
   sometimes even talks about semantics (e.g., type systems), but rarely, if
   ever, has any content (see <glossterm>content-free</glossterm>).  More
   broadly applied to talks &mdash; even when the topic is not a programming

<!-- from Joseph M. Newcomer <jn11+@andrew.cmu.edu>, 18 Feb 1991 -->

   <para>The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
   usually to write a compiler for it, then bootstrap the design away from
   contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it in itself.
   Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is <quote>Has it been
   used for anything besides its own compiler?</quote> On the other hand, a
   (compiled) language that cannot even be used to write its own compiler is
   beneath contempt.  (The qualification has become necessary because of the
   increasing popularity of interpreted languages like
   <glossterm>Perl</glossterm> and <glossterm>Python</glossterm>.) See
   <glossterm>break-even point</glossterm>.  (On a related note, Doug McIlroy
   once proposed a test of the generality and utility of a language and the
   operating system under which it is compiled: <quote>Is the output of a
   FORTRAN program acceptable as input to the FORTRAN compiler?</quote> In
   other words, can you write programs that write programs? (See
   <glossterm>toolsmith</glossterm>.)  Alarming numbers of (language, OS)
   pairs fail this test, particularly when the language is FORTRAN;
   aficionados are quick to point out that <glossterm>Unix</glossterm> (even
   using FORTRAN) passes it handily.  That the test could ever be failed is
   only surprising to those who have had the good fortune to have worked only
   under modern systems which lack OS-supported and -imposed <quote>file
   types</quote>.)</para>

   <para> 2. A quantifier prefix, calling for multiplication by

   hackers, but hackers tend to fling them both around rather more freely than
   is countenanced in standard English.  It is recorded, for example, that one
   CS professor used to characterize the standard length of his lectures as a
   microcentury &mdash; that is, about 52.6 minutes (see also
   <glossterm>attoparsec</glossterm>, <glossterm>nanoacre</glossterm>, and

   <para> 3. Personal or human-scale &mdash; that is, capable of being

   is generalized from <emphasis role='firstterm'>microcomputer</emphasis>,
   and is esp. used in contrast with <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>macro-</emphasis> (the corresponding Greek prefix meaning
   &lsquo;large&rsquo;).  </para>
</glossdef>
<glossdef>
   <para> 4. Local as opposed to global (or <glossterm>macro-</glossterm>).
   Thus a hacker might say that buying a smaller car to reduce pollution only
   solves a microproblem; the macroproblem of getting to work might be better
   solved by using mass transit, moving to within walking distance, or (best
   of all) telecommuting.</para>

   <para> A unit of talking speed, abbreviated mL.  Most people run about 200
   milliLampsons.  The eponymous Butler Lampson (a CS theorist and systems
   implementor highly regarded among hackers) goes at 1000.  A few people
   speak faster.  This unit is sometimes used to compare the (sometimes widely
   disparate) rates at which people can generate ideas and actually emit them
   in speech.  For example, noted computer architect C. Gordon Bell (designer
   of the <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>) is said, with some awe, to think at about 1200 mL but only
   talk at about 300; he is frequently reduced to fragments of sentences as
   his mouth tries to keep up with his speeding brain.</para>

   <para>
   [common] A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is
   not adequate for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
   deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a bug.
   Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the
   feature in question was carefully planned, but its long-term consequences
   were not accurately or adequately predicted (which is quite different from
   not having thought ahead at all).  A misfeature can be a particularly
   stubborn problem to resolve, because fixing it usually involves a
   substantial philosophical change to the structure of the system
   involved.</para>

   <para>Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise because
   the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes for laws of
   nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature because trade-offs
   were made whose parameters subsequently change (possibly only in the
   judgment of the implementors).  <quote>Well, yeah, it is kind of a
   misfeature that file names are limited to six characters, but the original
   implementors wanted to save directory space and we're stuck with it for
   now.</quote></para>

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge when it
   was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical memory size for a
   timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a moby is classically 256K
   36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or PDP-10 moby.  Back when address
   registers were narrow the term was more generally useful, because when a
   computer had virtual memory mapping, it might actually have more physical
   memory attached to it than any one program could access directly.  One
   could then say <quote>This computer has 6 mobies</quote> meaning that the
   ratio of physical memory to address space is 6, without having to say
   specifically how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that
   the computer could timeshare six &lsquo;full-sized&rsquo; programs without
   having to swap programs between memory and disk.</para>

   <para>Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto a
   machine, so most systems have much <emphasis>less</emphasis> than one
   theoretical &lsquo;native&rsquo; moby of <glossterm>core</glossterm>.
   Also, more modern memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the
   &lsquo;moby count&rsquo; less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived &mdash; the
   Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly
   <glossterm>brain-damaged</glossterm> segmented-memory designs.  On these, a
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>moby</emphasis> would be the 1-megabyte address
   span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1
   megabyte of 9-bit bytes).</para>

   <!-- The MIT PDP-10s each had two mobies, usually referred to as
   the <quote>low moby</quote> (0-777777) and <quote>high moby</quote>
   (1000000-1777777), or as <quote>moby 0</quote> and <quote>moby
   1</quote>.  MIT-AI had four mobies of address space: moby 2 was the
   PDP-6 memory, and moby 3 the <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm> interface.)  The size of the
   PDP-10 <quote>moby</quote> was often used as a generic unit of
   either address space (18 bits' worth) or of memory (about a
   megabyte, or 9/8 megabyte (if one accounts for difference between
   32- and 36-bit words), or 5/4 megacharacters). -->

   <para> [common] A general state, usually used with an adjective describing
   the state.  Use of the word &lsquo;mode&rsquo; rather than
   &lsquo;state&rsquo; implies that the state is extended over time, and
   probably also that some activity characteristic of that state is being
   carried out. <quote>No time to hack; I'm in thesis mode.</quote> In its
   jargon sense, &lsquo;mode&rsquo; is most often attributed to people, though
   it is sometimes applied to programs and inanimate objects. In particular,
   see <glossterm>hack mode</glossterm>, <glossterm>day mode</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>night mode</glossterm>, <glossterm>demo mode</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>fireworks mode</glossterm>, and 
   <glossterm>yoyo mode</glossterm>; also <glossterm>talk mode</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>One also often hears the verbs <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>enable</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>disable</emphasis> used in connection with jargon modes.
   Thus, for example, a sillier way of saying <quote>I'm going to
   crash</quote> is <quote>I'm going to enable crash mode now</quote>.  One
   might also hear a request to <quote>disable flame mode,
   please</quote>.</para>

   <para>In a usage much closer to techspeak, a mode is a special state that
   certain user interfaces must pass into in order to perform certain
   functions.  For example, in order to insert characters into a document in
   the Unix editor <command remap='code'>vi</command>, one must type the
   <quote>i</quote> key, which invokes the <quote>Insert</quote> command.  The
   effect of this command is to put vi into <quote>insert mode</quote>, in
   which typing the <quote>i</quote> key has a quite different effect (to wit,
   it inserts an <quote>i</quote> into the document).  One must then hit
   another special key, <quote>ESC</quote>, in order to leave <quote>insert
   mode</quote>.  Nowadays, modeful interfaces are generally considered
   <glossterm>losing</glossterm> but survive in quite a few widely used tools
   built in less enlightened times.</para>

   <para>Any one of several similar folk theorems that fit computing capacity
   or cost to a 2<superscript>t</superscript> exponential curve, with doubling
   time close to a year.  The most common fits component density to such a
   curve (previous versions of this entry gave that form).  Another variant
   asserts that the dollar cost of constant computing power decreases on the
   same curve.  The original Moore's Law, first uttered in 1965 by
   semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years
   later), spoke of the number of components on the lowest-cost silicon
   integrated circuits &mdash; but Moore's own formulation varied somewhat
   over the years, and reconstructing the meaning of the terminology he used
   in the original turns out to be fraught with difficulties.  Further
   variants were spawned by Intel's PR department and various
   journalists.</para>

   <para>It has been <ulink
   url="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html">shown</ulink>
   that none of the variants of Moore's Law actually fit the data very well
   (the price curves within DRAM generations perhaps come closest).
   Nevertheless, Moore's Law is constantly invoked to set up expectations
   about the next generation of computing technology.  See also

   <glossterm>CP/M</glossterm> for the 8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by
   hacker Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Products, who called the original
   QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) and is said to have regretted it
   ever since.  Microsoft licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for
   IBM on time, and the rest is history.  Numerous features, including vaguely
   Unix-like but rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection,
   and pipelines, were hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as
   a result, there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls,
   and MS-DOS programmers can never agree on basic things like what character
   to use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive.  The resulting
   appalling mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often known
   simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other similarly
   abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it
   was attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360).  The name
   further annoys those who know what the term 
   <glossterm>operating system</glossterm> does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly a set
   of relatively simple interrupt services.  Some people like to pronounce DOS
   like <quote>dose</quote>, as in <quote>I don't work on dose, man!</quote>,
   or to compare it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide
   circulation among hackers exhorts: <quote>MS-DOS: Just say No!</quote>).

</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game
   still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   <emphasis>BartleMUD</emphasis>s.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name MUD was
   trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (the
   motto: <quote>You haven't <emphasis>lived</emphasis> 'til you've
   <emphasis>died</emphasis> on MUD!</quote>); however, this is false &mdash;
   Richard Bartle explicitly placed &lsquo;MUD&rsquo; in the public domain in
   1985.  BT was upset at this, as they had already printed trademark claims
   on some maps and posters, which were released and created the myth.</para>

   <para>Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).  Many of
   these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction.
   Because these had an image as &lsquo;research&rsquo; they often survived
   administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This, together with the fact
   that Usenet feeds were often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made
   the MUDs major foci of hackish social interaction there.</para>

   <para>AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker
   communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers
   see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s).  The second
   wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social interaction,
   puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and
   competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred to as
   &lsquo;MU*&rsquo;, with &lsquo;MUD&rsquo; implicitly reserved for the more
   game-oriented ones).  By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major
   variety, LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and
   older systems with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge
   of the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a
   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.</para>

   <para>The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with
   new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.  Around 1991
   there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the term
   <glossterm>MUD</glossterm> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding
   variety of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  It survived.  See also <glossterm>bonk/oif</glossterm>,

   experience with is so much better than any other; and the MUD he or she is

   <para> [from <quote>MULTiplexed Information and Computing Service</quote>]
   An early timesharing <glossterm>operating system</glossterm> co-designed
   by a consortium including MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories as a successor to
   <glossterm>CTSS</glossterm>.  The design was first presented in 1965,
   planned for operation in 1967, first operational in 1969, and took several
   more years to achieve respectable performance and stability.</para>

   <para>Multics was very innovative for its time &mdash; among other things,
   it provided a hierarchical file system with access control on individual
   files and introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as special
   files.  It was also the first OS to run on a symmetric multiprocessor, and
   the only general-purpose system to be awarded a B2 security rating by the
   NSA (see <glossterm>Orange Book</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>Bell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that
   <glossterm>second-system effect</glossterm> had bloated Multics to the
   point of practical unusability.  Honeywell commercialized Multics in 1972
   after buying out GE's computer group, but it was never very successful: at
   its peak in the 1980s, there were between 75 and 100 Multics sites, each a
   multi-million dollar mainframe.</para>

   <para>One of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson,
   and <glossterm>Unix</glossterm> deliberately carried through and extended
   many of Multics' design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very name
   &lsquo;Unix&rsquo; as <quote>a weak pun on Multics</quote>.  For this and
   other reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
   debate among hackers.  See also <glossterm>brain-damaged</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>GCOS</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>MIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977.
   Honeywell sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and
   development on Multics was stopped in 1988.  Four Multics sites were known
   to be still in use as late as 1998, but the last one (a Canadian military
   site) was decommissioned in November 2000.  There is a Multics page at

   <para>Like many early hacker terms, this one seems to have originated at
   <glossterm>TMRC</glossterm>; it was already in use there in 1958.  Peter
   Samson (compiler of the original TMRC lexicon) thinks it may originally
   have been onomatopoeic for the sound of a relay spring (contact) being
   twanged.  However, it is known that during the World Wars,
   &lsquo;mung&rsquo; was U.S.: army slang for the ersatz creamed chipped beef
   better known as &lsquo;SOS&rsquo;, and it seems quite likely that the word
   in fact goes back to Scots-dialect <glossterm>munge</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> The correct, <emphasis>original</emphasis> Murphy's Law reads:
   <quote>If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways
   can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it.</quote> This is a
   principle of defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in
   mutant forms less descriptive of the challenges of design for
   <glossterm>luser</glossterm>s.  For example, you don't make a two-pin plug
   symmetrical and then label it <quote>THIS WAY UP</quote>; if it matters
   which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical (see also
   the anecdote under <glossterm>magic smoke</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of McDonnell-Douglas's test
   engineers on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air
   Force in 1949 to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).
   One experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different
   parts of the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be
   glued to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 in a
   replacement set the wrong way around.  Murphy then made the original form
   of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   mis-quoted (apparently in the more general form <quote>Whatever can go
   wrong, <emphasis>will</emphasis> go wrong)</quote> at a news conference a
   few days later.</para>

   <para>Within months &lsquo;Murphy's Law&rsquo; had spread to various
   technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many
   years had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on <quote>Anything that
   can go wrong, will</quote>; this is more correctly referred to as
   <glossterm>Finagle's Law</glossterm>.  The memetic drift apparent in these
   mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!</para>

   <glossterm>oriental food</glossterm>; see also <glossterm>filk</glossterm>).  Hackish folklore
   has long claimed that musical and programming abilities are closely
   related, and there has been at least one large-scale statistical study that
   supports this.  Hackers, as a rule, like music and often develop musical
   appreciation in unusual and interesting directions.  Folk music is very big
   in hacker circles; so is electronic music, and the sort of elaborate
   instrumental jazz/rock that used to be called &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; and
   isn't recorded much any more.  The hacker's musical range tends to be wide;
   many can listen with equal appreciation to (say) Talking Heads, Yes, Gentle
   Giant, Pat Metheny, Scott Joplin, Tangerine Dream, Dream Theater, King
   Sunny Ade, The Pretenders, Screaming Trees, or the Brandenburg Concerti.
   It is also apparently true that hackerdom includes a much higher
   concentration of talented amateur musicians than one would expect from a
   similar-sized control group of <glossterm>mundane</glossterm> types.</para>

   <para> A hypothetical fabrication technology in which objects are designed
   and built with the individual specification and placement of each separate
   atom.  The first unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in
   1990, for example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on a nickel
   substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large computer company.
   Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture ever since the
   term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book <citetitle>Engines of
   Creation</citetitle> (Anchor/Doubleday, ISBN 0-385-19973-2), where he
   predicted that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating assemblers,
   permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal wealth

   <para> The label used to refer to one of the continuing 
   <glossterm>holy wars</glossterm> in AI research.  This conflict tangles together two
   separate issues.  One is the relationship between human reasoning and AI;
   &lsquo;neats&rsquo; tend to try to build systems that &lsquo;reason&rsquo;
   in some way identifiably similar to the way humans report themselves as
   doing, while &lsquo;scruffies&rsquo; profess not to care whether an
   algorithm resembles human reasoning in the least as long as it works.  More
   importantly, neats tend to believe that logic is king, while scruffies
   favor looser, more ad-hoc methods driven by empirical knowledge.  To a
   neat, scruffy methods appear promiscuous, successful only by accident, and
   not productive of insights about how intelligence actually works; to a
   scruffy, neat methods appear to be hung up on formalism and irrelevant to
   the hard-to-capture &lsquo;common sense&rsquo; of living
   intelligences.</para>

   and very popular at Unix sites and on PC-class machines (nethack is

   changed when maintenance was taken over by a group of hackers originally

   <para>Network meltdown is often a result of network designs that are
   optimized for a steady state of moderate load and don't cope well with the
   very jagged, bursty usage patterns of the real world.  One amusing instance
   of this is triggered by the popular and very bloody shoot-'em-up game
   <citetitle>Doom</citetitle> on the PC.  When used in multiplayer
   mode over a network, the game uses broadcast packets to inform other
   machines when bullets are fired.  This causes problems with weapons like
   the chain gun which fire rapidly &mdash; it can blast the network into a
   meltdown state just as easily as it shreds opposing monsters.</para>

   <para> Pejorative hackerism for Sun's Network File System (NFS).  In any
   nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when
   one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to
   access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This
   causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to a higher
   <glossterm>spl</glossterm> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes
   pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both
   to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even
   harder to reach.  This situation snowballs very quickly, and soon the
   entire network of machines is frozen &mdash; worst of all, the user can't
   even abort the file access that started the problem!  Many of NFS's
   problems are excused by partisans as being an inevitable result of its
   statelessness, which is held to be a great feature (critics, of course,
   call it a great <glossterm>misfeature</glossterm>).  (ITS partisans are apt
   to cite this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working
   NFS-like shared file system with none of these problems in the early
   1970s.)  See also <glossterm>broadcast storm</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> The National Security Agency trawling program sometimes assumed to

   think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in
   case.  Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA
   actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program.</para>

   <para>The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like
   &lsquo;KGB&rsquo;, &lsquo;Uzi&rsquo;, &lsquo;nuclear materials&rsquo;,
   &lsquo;Palestine&rsquo;, &lsquo;cocaine&rsquo;, and

   has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious anarcho-verbiage
   into your edited text.</para>
<!-- ESR -->

   <para>As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this myth
   involving a &lsquo;Trunk Line Monitor&rsquo;, which supposedly used speech
   recognition to extract words from telephone trunks.  This is much harder
   than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who originally
   propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or the storage,
   signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a project.  On the
   basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper to hire 50
   high-school students and just let them listen in.</para>

   <para>Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later,
   however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually deployed
   such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law).  In 2000, the FBI wants
   to get into this act with its &lsquo;Carnivore&rsquo; surveillance

   <para> (in full, the &lsquo;International Obfuscated C Code Contest&rsquo;,
   or IOCCC) An annual contest run since 1984 over Usenet by Landon Curt Noll
   and friends.  The overall winner is whoever produces the most unreadable,
   creative, and bizarre (but working) C program; various other prizes are
   awarded at the judges' whim.  C's terse syntax and macro-preprocessor
   facilities give contestants a lot of maneuvering room.  The winning
   programs often manage to be simultaneously (a) funny, (b) breathtaking
   works of art, and (c) horrible examples of how <emphasis>not</emphasis> to
   code in C.</para>

   <para>This relatively short and sweet entry might help convey the flavor of
   obfuscated C:</para>

<programlisting>
/*
 * HELLO WORLD program

 * (Note: depends on being able to modify elements of argv[],

main(v,c)char**c;{for(v[c++]="Hello, world!\n)";
(!!c)[*c]&amp;&amp;(v--||--c&amp;&amp;execlp(*c,*c,c[!!c]+!!c,!c));

   <para>This term is much older than computing, and is (uncommon) slang
   elsewhere.  A trolley is the small wheel that trolls, or runs against, the
   heavy wire that carries the current to run a streetcar.  It's at the end of
   the long pole (the trolley pole) that reaches from the roof of the
   streetcar to the overhead line.  When the trolley stops making contact with
   the wire (from passing through a switch, going over bumpy track, or
   whatever), the streetcar comes to a halt, (usually) without crashing.  The
   streetcar is then said to be off the trolley, or off the wire.  Later on,
   trolley came to mean the streetcar itself.  Since streetcars became common
   in the 1890s, the term is more than 100 years old.  Nowadays, trolleys are
   only seen on historic streetcars, since modern streetcars use pantographs
   to contact the wire.</para>

   a counterfeit, or some otherwise slightly bogus resemblance.  Hackers will
   happily use it with all sorts of non-Greco/Latin stem words that wouldn't
   keep company with it in mainstream English.  For example, <quote>He's a

   notably in the term &lsquo;trendoid&rsquo; for victims of terminal

   <para> A game popular among hackers who code in the language APL (see
   <glossterm>write-only language</glossterm> and 
   <glossterm>line noise</glossterm>).  The objective is to see who can code the most

   APL's exceedingly <glossterm>hairy</glossterm> primitive set.  A similar
   amusement was practiced among <glossterm>TECO</glossterm> hackers and is
   now popular among <glossterm>Perl</glossterm> aficionados.</para>

   <para>Ken Iverson, the inventor of APL, has been credited with a one-liner
   that, given a number <literal>N</literal>, produces a list of
   the prime numbers from 1 to <literal>N</literal> inclusive.
   It looks like this:</para>

<programlisting>
 	(2=0+.=T&empty;.|T)/T&larr;&iota;N
</programlisting>

   <para>Here's a <glossterm>Perl</glossterm> program that prints
   primes:</para>

<programlisting>
        perl -wle '(1 x $_) !~ /^(11+)\1+$/ &amp;&amp; print while ++ $_'
</programlisting>

   <para>In the Perl world this game is sometimes called Perl Golf because the
   player with the fewest (key)strokes wins.</para>

   <para> [from the Dr. Seuss title <citetitle>Bartholomew and the

   water.  Enjoyed among hackers who make batches during playtime at parties
   for its amusing and extremely non-Newtonian behavior; it pours and
   splatters, but resists rapid motion like a solid and will even crack when
   hit by a hammer.  Often found near lasers.</para>
<!-- This refers to the fact that Hobbit and the Frob Mob made it a lot. -->

   <para>Here is a field-tested ooblick recipe contributed by GLS:</para>

   <para>This recipe isn't quite as non-Newtonian as a pure cornstarch
   ooblick, but has an appropriately slimy feel.</para>

   <para>Some, however, insist that the notion of an ooblick
   <emphasis>recipe</emphasis> is far too mechanical, and that it is best to
   add the water in small increments so that the various mixed states the

   <para> [common; also adj. <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>open-source</emphasis>] Term coined in March 1998
   following the Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source
   under licenses guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and
   redistribute, the code.  The intent was to be able to sell the hackers'
   ways of doing software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the
   negative connotations (to <glossterm>suit</glossterm>s) of the term
   <quote><glossterm>free software</glossterm></quote>.  For discussion of the
   follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the <ulink
   url='http://www.opensource.org'>Open Source Initiative</ulink>
   site.</para>
</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Five years after this term was invented, in 2003, it is worth noting
   the huge shift in assumptions it helped bring about, if only because the
   hacker culture's collective memory of what went before is in some ways
   blurring. Hackers have so completely refocused themselves around the idea
   and ideal of open source that we are beginning to forget that we used to do
   most of our work in closed-source environments.  Until the late 1990s open
   source was a sporadic exception that usually had to live on top of a
   closed-source operating system and alongside closed-source tools; entire
   open-source environments like <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> and the *BSD
   systems didn't even exist in a usable form until around 1993 and weren't
   taken very seriously by anyone but a pioneering few until about five years
   later. </para>

   especially Chinese, and especially of the spicier varieties such as
   Szechuan and Hunan.  This phenomenon (which has also been observed in
   subcultures that overlap heavily with hackerdom, most notably
   science-fiction fandom) has never been satisfactorily explained, but is
   sufficiently intense that one can assume the target of a hackish dinner
   expedition to be the best local Chinese place and be right at least three
   times out of four.  See also <glossterm>ravs</glossterm>,

   <para> The anointed successor to MS-DOS for Intel 286- and 386-based
   micros; proof that IBM/Microsoft couldn't get it right the second time,
   either.  Often called &lsquo;Half-an-OS&rsquo;.  Mentioning it is usually
   good for a cheap laugh among hackers &mdash; the design was so
   <glossterm>baroque</glossterm>, and the implementation of 1.x so bad, that
   three years after introduction you could still count the major
   <glossterm>app</glossterm>s shipping for it on the fingers of two hands
   &mdash; in unary.  The 2.x versions were said to have improved somewhat,
   and informed hackers rated them superior to Microsoft Windows (an
   endorsement which, however, could easily be construed as damning with faint
   praise).  In the mid-1990s IBM put OS/2 on life support, refraining from
   killing it outright purely for internal political reasons; by 1999 the

   <para> An Algol-descended language designed by Niklaus Wirth on the CDC
   6600 around 1967--68 as an instructional tool for elementary programming.
   This language, designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves
   in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a
   general-purpose-programming point of view, was later promoted as a
   general-purpose tool and, in fact, became the ancestor of a large family of
   languages including Modula-2 and Ada (see also
   <glossterm>bondage-and-discipline language</glossterm>).  The hackish point
   of view on Pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating (and, in its
   deadpan way, screamingly funny) 1981 paper by Brian Kernighan (of
   <glossterm linkend='K-ampersand-R'>K&amp;R</glossterm> fame) entitled
   <citetitle>Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language</citetitle>,
   which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via
   photocopies.  It was eventually published in <citetitle>Comparing and
   Assessing Programming Languages</citetitle>, edited by Alan Feuer and
   Narain Gehani (Prentice-Hall, 1984).  Part of his discussion is worth
   repeating here, because its criticisms are still apposite to Pascal itself
   after many years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of
   many other bondage-and-discipline languages.  (The entire essay is
   available at <ulink
   url='http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html'>http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html</ulink>.)
   At the end of a summary of the case against Pascal, Kernighan wrote:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'>
<para>9. There is no escape</para>

<para>This last point is perhaps the most important.  The language is
inadequate but circumscribed, because there is no way to escape its
limitations.  There are no casts to disable the type-checking when necessary.
There is no way to replace the defective run-time environment with a sensible
one, unless one controls the compiler that defines the <quote>standard
procedures</quote>.  The language is closed.</para>

<para>People who use Pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal trap.
Because the language is impotent, it must be extended.  But each group extends
Pascal in its own direction, to make it look like whatever language they
really want.  Extensions for separate compilation, FORTRAN-like COMMON, string
data types, internal static variables, initialization, octal numbers, bit
operators, etc., all add to the utility of the language for one group but
destroy its portability to others.</para>

<para>I feel that it is a mistake to use Pascal for anything much beyond its
original target.  In its pure form, Pascal is a toy language, suitable for
teaching but not for real programming.</para>
</blockquote>

   <para>Pascal has since been entirely displaced (mainly by
   <glossterm>C</glossterm>) from the niches it had acquired in serious
   applications and systems programming, and from its role as a teaching
   language by Java.</para>

   shortly thereafter learned something about proper procedures.</para>

   facilities and research labs, including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford, and CMU.
   Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the bit-field
   instructions) are still considered unsurpassed.  The 10 was eventually
   eclipsed by the <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> machines (descendants of the
   <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>) when <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> recognized
   that the 10 and <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> product lines were competing
   with each other and decided to concentrate its software development effort
   on the more profitable <glossterm>VAX</glossterm>.  The machine was finally
   dropped from DEC's line in 1983, following the failure of the Jupiter
   Project at DEC to build a viable new model.  (Some attempts by other
   companies to market clones came to nothing; see
   <glossterm>Foonly</glossterm> and <glossterm>Mars</glossterm>.)  This event
   spelled the doom of <glossterm>ITS</glossterm> and the technical cultures
   that had spawned the original Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become
   something of a badge of honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut
   one's teeth on a PDP-10.  See <glossterm>TOPS-10</glossterm>,

   <para>True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did
   depend on the phase of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had
   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this routine into
   a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a timestamp line
   almost 80 characters long.  Very occasionally the first line of the message
   would be too long and would overflow onto the next line, and when the file
   was later read back in the program would <glossterm>barf</glossterm>.  The
   length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the
   length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so
   the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!</para>

   <para>The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
   example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
   typesetter &lsquo;corrected&rsquo; it.  This has since been described as
   the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.</para>

   <para>However, beware of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN
   (European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
   experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the formidable
   amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers
   before being seen by humans, many people suggested the software was somehow
   sensitive to the phase of the moon.  A few desperate engineers discovered
   the truth; the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the
   geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically caused by the
   deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon!  This story has
   entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and
   as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to
   the most modern science.</para>

   <para>At one time phreaking was a semi-respectable activity among hackers;
   there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game
   and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was taboo.
   There was significant crossover between the hacker community and the
   hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their own
   through such media as the legendary <citetitle>TAP Newsletter</citetitle>.
   This ethos began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of
   the techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around
   the same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
   depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card numbers.
   The crimes and punishments of gangs like the &lsquo;414 group&rsquo; turned
   that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just to
   keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
   &lsquo;blue boxes&rsquo; or any of the other paraphernalia of the great
   phreaks of yore.</para>

isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT

sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly
invoked
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ping</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
listened for an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet.
Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and over,
<quote>Ping &ellipsis; ping &ellipsis; ping &ellipsis;</quote> as long as the
network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the

   vulnerability within days or weeks, the closed-source OS vendors generally
   took months.  While the difference in response times repeated a pattern
   familiar from other security incidents, the accompanying glare of
   Web-fueled publicity proved unusually embarrassing to the OS vendors and so
   passed into history and myth.  The term is now used to refer to any nudge

   <para>In the late 1980s, researchers at Bell Labs (especially Rob Pike of

   <para> [Unix] On systems that support <glossterm>finger</glossterm>, the
   <filename>.plan</filename> file in a user's home directory is displayed
   when the user is fingered.  This feature was originally intended to be used
   to keep potential fingerers apprised of one's location and near-future
   plans, but has been turned almost universally to humorous and
   self-expressive purposes (like a <glossterm>sig block</glossterm>).  See
   also <glossterm>Hacking X for Y</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>A recent innovation in plan files has been the introduction of
   <quote>scrolling plan files</quote> which are one-dimensional animations
   made using only the printable ASCII character set, carriage return and line
   feed, avoiding terminal specific escape sequences, since the
   <glossterm>finger</glossterm> command will (for security reasons; see
   <glossterm>letterbomb</glossterm>) not pass the escape character.</para>
<!-- ESR -->

   <para>Scrolling .plan files have become art forms in miniature, and some
   sites have started competitions to find who can create the longest running,
   funniest, and most original animations.  Various animation characters
   include: <informaltable> <tgroup cols='2'> <tbody>

   <para> Standard, against which all others of the same category are
   measured.  Usage: silly.  The notion is that one of whatever it is has
   actually been cast in platinum-iridium alloy and placed in the vault beside
   the Standard Kilogram at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
   near Paris.  (From 1889 to 1960, the meter was defined to be the distance
   between two scratches in a platinum-iridium bar kept in that same vault
   &mdash; this replaced an earlier definition as
   <literal>10<superscript>-7</superscript></literal> times the distance
   between the North Pole and the Equator along a meridian through Paris;
   unfortunately, this had been based on an inexact value of the circumference
   of the Earth.  From 1960 to 1984 it was defined to be 1650763.73
   wavelengths of the orange-red line of krypton-86 propagating in a vacuum.
   It is now defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum
   in the time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.  The kilogram is now the
   only unit of measure officially defined in terms of a unique artifact. But
   this will have to change; in 2003 it was revealed that the reference
   kilogram has been shedding mass over time, and is down by 50 micrograms.)

   <para>[proposed] Several of the key Internet <glossterm>RFC</glossterm>s,
   especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel, 
   which is most often stated as:</para>

   <blockquote>  
   <para><quote>Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you
   send.</quote></para>
   </blockquote>

   <para>That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the
   Internet protocols should be willing to deal with marginal
   and imperfectly-formed inputs, but should not assume that the
   program on the other end (that is, the program dealing with the
   well-engineered implementation's output) will be anything other
   than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps even incomplete or downright
   buggy.</para>

   <para>This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering
   to it will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties
   in the protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's
   failure to understand those specifications perfectly.  Though the
   policy does tend to accommodate broken implementations it is held
   to more important to get the communication flowing than to
   immediately (but terminally) diagnose the broken implementations
   at the expense of the people trying to use them.</para>

   <para>The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs
   that handle Internet wire protocols, especially network
   relays and servers, and it is regularly applied by extension
   in any situation where two or more separately-implemented
   pieces of software are supposed to interoperate even though the
   various implementors have never talked to each other and have
   absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having
   all read the same protocol specification.  The principle travels
   under several different names, including <quote>the Internet credo</quote>,
   <quote>the IETF maxim</quote>, <quote>the Internet Engineering
   Principle</quote>, and
   <quote>the liberal/conservative rule</quote>; the [proposed] term
   <quote>Postel' Prescription</quote> is a tribute to its inventor, the first
   RFC editor
   and (until his untimely death) probably the single most respected
   individual in the Internet engineering community.</para>

   <para> A page description language, based on work originally done by John
   Gaffney at Evans and Sutherland in 1976, evolving through &lsquo;JaM&rsquo;
   (&lsquo;John and Martin&rsquo;, Martin Newell) at <glossterm>XEROX
   PARC</glossterm>, and finally implemented in its current form by John
   Warnock et al. after he and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems
   Incorporated in 1982.  PostScript gets its leverage by using a full
   programming language, rather than a series of low-level escape sequences,
   to describe an image to be printed on a laser printer or other output
   device (in this it parallels <glossterm>EMACS</glossterm>, which exploited
   a similar insight about editing tasks).  It is also noteworthy for
   implementing on-the fly rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of
   high-quality fonts at low (e.g.  300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly
   believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task).
   Hackers consider PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time,
   and the combination of technical merits and widespread availability has
   made PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.</para>

   <para> [University of Wisconsin] The euphoria experienced upon the
   completion of a program or other computer-related project.  For example,
   the rush you get when you finally run the code you've been hacking for the
   past week and it works first time. (The quality of the experience is
   directly proportional to the complexity of the code and inversely
   proportional to the amount of debugging it took to get the code working.)

   <para> [UK] A short <foreignphrase>extempore</foreignphrase> program written
   to meet an immediate, transient need.  Often written in BASIC, rarely more

   of code that can be written off the top of one's head, that does not need
   any editing, and that runs correctly the first time (this amount varies

   <para> As used by hackers, this never refers to niceties about the proper
   form for addressing letters to the Papal Nuncio or the order in which one
   should use the forks in a Russian-style place setting; hackers don't care
   about such things.  It is used instead to describe any set of rules that

   other without ambiguity.  So, for example, it does include niceties about
   the proper form for addressing packets on a network or the order in which
   one should use the forks in the Dining Philosophers Problem.  It implies
   that there is some common message format and an accepted set of primitives
   or commands that all parties involved understand, and that transactions

   <para> [techspeak] (alt.: <emphasis role='firstterm'>punch card</emphasis>)
   The signature medium of computing's <glossterm>Stone Age</glossterm>, now
   obsolescent.  The punched card actually predated computers considerably,
   originating in 1801 as a control device for mechanical looms.  The version
   patented by Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the
   1890 U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm.  There is
   a widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used
   for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have
   falsified this.</para>

   <para>IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns of
   small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per card.
   Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried at various
   times.</para>

   <para>The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the
   IBM punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
   with many varieties of computers even today.  See

   <para> In the words of its author, <quote>the other scripting
   language</quote> (other than <glossterm>Perl</glossterm>, that is).
   Python's design is notably clean, elegant, and well thought through; it
   tends to attract the sort of programmers who find Perl grubby and exiguous.
   Some people revolt at its use of whitespace to define logical structure by
   indentation, objecting that this harks back to the horrible old fixed-field
   languages of the 1960s.  Python's relationship with Perl is rather like the
   <glossterm>BSD</glossterm> community's relationship to
   <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> &mdash; it's the smaller party in a (usually
   friendly) rivalry, but the average quality of its developers is generally
   conceded to be rather higher than in the larger community it competes with.

   <para> In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric prefixes used in the SI
   (Syst&egrave;me International) conventions for scientific measurement have
   dual uses.  With units of time or things that come in powers of 10, such as
   money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by powers of
   <literal>1000 = 10^3</literal>.  But when used with bytes or
   other things that naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote
   multiplication by powers of <literal>1024 = 2^10</literal>.</para>

   <para>Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use:</para>

<literallayout remap='smallexample'>
prefix  decimal  binary
kilo-   1000^1   1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024 
mega-   1000^2   1024^2 = 2^20 = 1,048,576 
giga-   1000^3   1024^3 = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 
tera-   1000^4   1024^4 = 2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776 
peta-   1000^5   1024^5 = 2^50 = 1,125,899,906,842,624

</literallayout>

   <para>Here are the SI fractional prefixes:</para>

<literallayout remap='example'>
prefix  decimal     jargon usage
milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see <glossterm>micro-</glossterm>)
nano-   1000^-3     even smaller (see <glossterm>nano-</glossterm>)
pico-   1000^-4     even smaller yet (see <glossterm>pico-</glossterm>)
femto-  1000^-5     (not used in jargon&mdash;yet)
atto-   1000^-6     (not used in jargon&mdash;yet)
zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon&mdash;yet)
yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon&mdash;yet)
</literallayout>

   <para>The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in
   these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were adopted in
   1990 by the <foreignphrase>19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures</foreignphrase>.  The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well
   established, are not in jargon use either &mdash; yet.  The prefix milli-,
   denoting multiplication by <literal>1/1000</literal>, has
   always been rare in jargon (there is, however, a standard joke about the
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>millihelen</emphasis> &mdash; notionally, the
   amount of beauty required to launch one ship).  See the entries on
   <glossterm>micro-</glossterm>, <glossterm>pico-</glossterm>, and
   <glossterm>nano-</glossterm> for more information on connotative jargon use
   of these terms.  &lsquo;Femto&rsquo; and &lsquo;atto&rsquo; (which,
   interestingly, derive not from Greek but from Danish) have not yet acquired
   jargon loadings, though it is easy to predict what those will be once
   computing technology enters the required realms of magnitude (however, see
   <glossterm>attoparsec</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10.
   In the following table, the &lsquo;prefix&rsquo; column is the
   international standard prefix for the appropriate power of ten; the
   &lsquo;binary&rsquo; column lists jargon abbreviations and words for the
   corresponding power of 2.  The B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte
   quantities; the words &lsquo;meg&rsquo; and &lsquo;gig&rsquo; are nouns
   that may (but do not always) pluralize with &lsquo;s&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus <quote>2K dollars</quote>,
   <quote>2M of disk space</quote>.  This is also true (though less commonly)
   of G.</para>

   <para>Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is &lsquo;k&rsquo;;
   some use this strictly, reserving &lsquo;K&rsquo; for multiplication by
   1024 (KB is thus &lsquo;kilobytes&rsquo;).</para>

   <para>K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64
   gigabytes and &lsquo;a K&rsquo; is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of
   &lsquo;a G&rsquo; as short for &lsquo;a grand&rsquo;, that is, $1000).
   Whether one pronounces &lsquo;gig&rsquo; with hard or soft &lsquo;g&rsquo;
   depends on what one thinks the proper pronunciation of &lsquo;giga-&rsquo;
   is.</para>

   <para>Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) &mdash; for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or
   524K instead of 512K &mdash; is a sure sign of the
   <glossterm>marketroid</glossterm>.  One example of this: it is common to
   refer to the capacity of 3.5&quot; floppies as &lsquo;1.44 MB&rsquo; In
   fact, this is a completely <glossterm>bogus</glossterm> number.  The
   correct size is 1440 KB, that is, 1440 * 1024 = 1474560 bytes.  So the
   &lsquo;mega&rsquo; in &lsquo;1.44 MB&rsquo; is compounded of two
   &lsquo;kilos&rsquo;, one of which is 1024 and the other of which is 1000.
   The correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.
   Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever.  [1993 update:
   hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on Usenet, the
   following additional prefixes:</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols='2'>
<tbody>
<row><entry>groucho</entry><entry>10^-30</entry></row>
<row><entry>harpo</entry><entry>10^-27</entry></row>
<row><entry>harpi</entry><entry>10^27</entry></row>
<row><entry>grouchi</entry><entry>10^30</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>

   <para>We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion.  Sadly, there is little immediate
   prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will be
   ratified.]</para>

   <para> A theory that characterizes the universe in terms of bogon sources
   (such as politicians, used-car salesmen, TV evangelists, and
   <glossterm>suit</glossterm>s in general), bogon sinks (such as taxpayers
   and computers), and bogosity potential fields.  Bogon absorption, of
   course, causes human beings to behave mindlessly and machines to fail (and
   may also cause both to emit secondary bogons); however, the precise
   mechanics of the bogon-computron interaction are not yet understood and
   remain to be elucidated.  Quantum bogodynamics is most often invoked to
   explain the sharp increase in hardware and software failures in the
   presence of suits; the latter emit bogons, which the former absorb.  See
   <glossterm>bogon</glossterm>, <glossterm>computron</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>suit</glossterm>, <glossterm>psyton</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Here is a representative QBD theory: The bogon is a boson (integral
   spin, +1 or -1), and has zero rest mass.  In this respect it is very much
   like a photon.  However, it has a much greater momentum, thus explaining
   its destructive effect on computer electronics and human nervous systems.
   The corollary to this is that bogons also have tremendous inertia, and
   therefore a bogon beam is deflected only with great difficulty.  When the
   bogon encounters its antiparticle, the cluon, they mutually annihilate each
   other, releasing magic smoke.  Furthermore 1 Lenat = 1 mole (6.022E23) of
   bogons (see <glossterm>microLenat</glossterm>).</para>

   <para> [from the name of the logician Willard van Orman Quine, via Douglas
   Hofstadter] A program that generates a copy of its own source text as its
   complete output.  Devising the shortest possible quine in some given
   programming language is a common hackish amusement.  (We ignore some
   variants of BASIC in which a program consisting of a single empty string
   literal reproduces itself trivially.)  Here is one classic quine:</para>

<programlisting>
((lambda (x)
  (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
 (quote
    (lambda (x)
      (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))
</programlisting>

   <para>This one works in LISP or Scheme.  It's relatively easy to write
   quines in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle programs
   as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!)  in languages like C
   which do not.  Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines:</para>

<programlisting>
char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()
{printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";
main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}
</programlisting>

   <para>For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line
   breaks.  Here is another elegant quine in ANSI C:</para>

<programlisting>
#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");}
q(#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");})
</programlisting>

   <para>Some infamous <glossterm>Obfuscated C Contest</glossterm> entries
   have been quines that reproduced in exotic ways.  There is an amusing

   <para>Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a
   <glossterm>fossil</glossterm>.  It is sometimes said that it was designed
   to slow down the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to allow
   <emphasis>faster</emphasis> typing &mdash; under a constraint now long
   obsolete.  In early typewriters, fast typing using nearby type-bars jammed
   the mechanism.  So Sholes fiddled the layout to separate the letters of
   many common digraphs (he did a far from perfect job, though;
   &lsquo;th&rsquo;, &lsquo;tr&rsquo;, &lsquo;ed&rsquo;, and &lsquo;er&rsquo;,
   for example, each use two nearby keys).  Also, putting the letters of
   &lsquo;typewriter&rsquo; on one line allowed it to be typed with particular
   speed and accuracy for <glossterm>demo</glossterm>s.  The jamming problem
   was essentially solved soon afterward by a suitable use of springs, but the
   keyboard layout lives on.</para>

   to built special-purpose contraptions for this purpose alone.  One
   well-known website offers random bits <ulink
   url='http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/'> generated by radioactive
   decay</ulink>.  Another derives random bits from <ulink

   Originally, the latter site got its random bits by doing photometry on lava
   lamps.  Hackers invariably found this hilarious.  If you have to ask why,
   you'll never get it.)</para>

   files. The hotter the contents of the server are, the smaller the ratio
   is. More often than not, the server refuses uploads because its disk is

   <para> Hacker's-eye introduction traditionally included in the top-level
   directory of a Unix source distribution, containing a pointer to more
   detailed documentation, credits, miscellaneous revision history, notes,
   etc.  In the Mac and PC worlds, software is not usually distributed in
   source form, and the README is more likely to contain user-oriented
   material like last-minute documentation changes, error workarounds, and
   restrictions.  When asked, hackers invariably relate the README convention
   to the famous scene in Lewis Carroll's <citetitle>Alice's Adventures In
   Wonderland</citetitle> in which Alice confronts magic munchies labeled
   <quote>Eat Me</quote> and <quote>Drink Me</quote>.</para>

   <para>The file may be named README, or READ.ME, or rarely ReadMe or
   readme.txt or some other variant.  The all-upper-case spellings,
   however, are universal among Unix programmers.  By ancient tradition,
   real source files have all-lowercase names and all-uppercase is
   reserved for metadata, comments, and grafitti.  This is functional;
   because 'A' sorts before 'a' in ASCII, the README will appear in directory
   listings before any source file.</para>

   Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been tuned into a

   <para> Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of
   general-purpose registers.  This is especially a problem for
   compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store
   temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression evaluation.
   Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do have a handful of
   special-purpose registers that can be pressed into service, providing
   suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side effects on the state of the
   processor: while the special-purpose register is being used to hold an
   intermediate value, a delicate minuet is required in which the previous
   value of the register is saved and then restored just before the official
   function (and value) of the special-purpose register is again
   needed.</para>

   <para> A <glossterm>bug</glossterm> or design error that limits a program's

   Often used (esp. by <glossterm>marketroid</glossterm> types) to make it
   sound as though some crippling bogosity had been intended by the designers
   all along, or was forced upon them by arcane technical constraints of a
   nature no mere user could possibly comprehend (these claims are almost
   invariably false).</para>

   <para>Old-time hacker Joseph M. Newcomer advises that whenever choosing a
   quantifiable but arbitrary restriction, you should make it either a power
   of 2 or a power of 2 minus 1.  If you impose a limit of 107 items in a
   list, everyone will know it is a random number &mdash; on the other hand, a
   limit of 15 or 16 suggests some deep reason (involving 0- or 1-based
   indexing in binary) and you will get less <glossterm>flamage</glossterm>
   for it.  Limits which are round numbers in base 10 are always especially
   suspect.</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> [Request For Comment] One of a long-es&shy;tab&shy;lished series of
   numbered Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by
   commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.
   Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet
   mail-format standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the
   Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution
   such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted
   as standards.</para>

   <para>The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important
   advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI
   or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a
   flourishing tradition of &lsquo;joke&rsquo; RFCs; usually at least one a
   year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known joke RFCs have
   included 527 (<quote>ARPAWOCKY</quote>, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973),
   748 (<quote>Telnet Randomly-Lose Option</quote>, Mark R. Crispin; 1 April
   1978), and 1149 (<quote>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on
   Avian Carriers</quote>, D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990).  The first was
   a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation
   style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese,
   describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier
   pigeon (since actually implemented; see Appendix A).  See also
   <glossterm>Infinite-Monkey Theorem</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work &mdash; they
   frequently manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in
   informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that
   often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to
   truly worldwide proportions.</para>

   ratified standards document.  The existence of these standards documents
   (and the technically inappropriate but politically mandated compromises
   that they inevitably contain, and the impenetrable
   <glossterm>legalese</glossterm> in which they are invariably written, and
   the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are produced)
   can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a certain amount of ambiguity
   in the specifications of the systems they use.  (Hackers feel that such
   ambiguities are acceptable as long as the <glossterm>Right

   casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when a system
   becomes popular in the <glossterm>Real World</glossterm>.)  Since a hacker
   is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
   technically deficient, the deprecation inherent in this term may be
   directed as much against the standard as against the person who ought to

   parallel to <glossterm>El Camino Bignum</glossterm>).  Palo Alto is
   adjacent to Stanford University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.
   We ate at The Good Earth, a &lsquo;health food&rsquo; restaurant, very
   popular, the sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.
   JONL ordered such a shake &mdash; the waitress claimed the flavor of the
   day was <quote>lalaberry</quote>.  I still have no idea what that might be,
   but it became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said
   it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I have ever had
   in a Mexican restaurant.</para>

   <para>After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
   Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of intriguing
   flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: <quote>If you don't live
   near an Uncle Gaylord's &mdash; MOVE!</quote> Also, Uncle Gaylord (a real
   person) wages a constant battle to force big-name ice cream makers to print
   their ingredients on the package (like air and plastic and other
   non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the
   previous August, when we had flown to a computer-science conference in
   Berkeley, California, the first time either of us had been on the West
   Coast.  When not in the conference sessions, we had spent our time
   wandering the length of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in
   Cambridge) was lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little
   shops.  On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The
   ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL went
   absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
   honey.</para>

   <para>Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth &mdash; indeed, after every
   lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit &mdash; a trip to
   Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had arrived on a
   Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there at least four times.
   Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice cream, and proclaim to all
   bystanders that <quote>Ginger was the spice that drove the Europeans mad!
   That's why they sought a route to the East!  They used it to preserve their
   otherwise off-taste meat.</quote> After the third or fourth repetition RPG
   and I were getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase
   him: <quote>Wow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste
   good!</quote> <quote>Say!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over
   and sat in the sun for a week and put some <emphasis>ginger</emphasis> on
   it for dinner?!</quote> <quote>Right!  With a lalaberry shake!</quote> And
   so on.  This failed to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we
   kept returning to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.</para>

   <para>Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
   (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them JONL
   and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their choosing.  I
   unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had <emphasis role='i'>je
   ne sais quoi du jour</emphasis>, but RPG and JONL had <emphasis
   role='i'>lapin</emphasis> (rabbit).  (Waitress: <quote><emphasis
   role='i'>Oui</emphasis>, we have fresh rabbit, fresh today.</quote> RPG:
   <quote>Well, JONL, I guess we won't need any
   <emphasis>ginger</emphasis>!</quote>)</para>

   <para>We finished the meal late, about 11PM, which is 2AM Boston time, so
   JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet midnight.  Off to Uncle
   Gaylord's!</para>

   <para>Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.
   In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north instead
   of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference had RPG not
   mentioned it.  We still knew very little of the local geography.  I did
   figure out, however, that we were headed in the direction of Berkeley, and
   half-jokingly suggested that we continue north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in
   Berkeley.</para>

   <para>RPG said <quote>Fine!</quote> and we drove on for a while and talked.
   I was drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.  When
   he awoke, RPG said, <quote>Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way over
   the bridge!</quote>, referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay.  Just
   then we came to a sign that said <quote>University Avenue</quote>.  I
   mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue; RPG said
   <quote>Right!</quote> and maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled up in
   front of an Uncle Gaylord's.</para>

   <para>Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
   and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me in on it
   a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice that we had
   somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after all.</para>

   <para>JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
   caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night, and
   looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He said,
   <quote>This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!  It looked
   like a barn!  But this place looks <emphasis>just like</emphasis> the one
   back in Palo Alto!</quote></para>

   <para>RPG deadpanned, <quote>Well, this is the one <emphasis>I</emphasis>
   always come to when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco,
   too.  Remember, they're a chain.</quote></para>

   <para>JONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant
   &mdash; he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley, not
   far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that there is a
   completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.</para>

   <para>JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy at
   the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first, evidently
   their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too many people like
   it.</para>

   <para>JONL said, <quote>I'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone.</quote>
   The guy behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first.
   <quote>Some people think it tastes like soap.</quote> JONL insisted,
   <quote>Look, I <emphasis>love</emphasis> ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I
   eat raw ginger roots.  I already went through this hassle with the guy back
   in Palo Alto.  I <emphasis>know</emphasis> I like that
   flavor!</quote></para>

   <para>At the words <quote>back in Palo Alto</quote> the guy behind the
   counter got a very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught
   his eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped what
   was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor laughing and
   clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched into his spiel
   (<quote>makes rotten meat a dish for princes</quote>) for the forty-third
   time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.</para>

   <para>RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our chuckles.
   JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream with the guy b.t.c.,
   comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream shops and generally having a
   good old time.</para>

   <para>At length the g.b.t.c.: said, <quote>How's the ginger honey?</quote>
   JONL said, <quote>Fine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?</quote> Now Uncle
   Gaylord publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
   his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c.: got out the recipe, and he and
   JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c.: could contain his
   curiosity no longer, and asked again, <quote>You really like that stuff,
   huh?</quote> JONL said, <quote>Yeah, I've been eating it constantly back in
   Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I think this batch is about as
   good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto!</quote></para>

   <para>G.b.t.c.: looked him straight in the eye and said, <quote>You're
   <emphasis>in</emphasis> Palo Alto!</quote></para>

   <para>JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a fit
   of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed, <quote>I've
   been hacked!</quote></para>

   <para><quote>Scram</quote> was in origin a backronym for <quote>Safety Cut
   Rope Axe Man</quote> coined by Enrico Fermi himself.  The story goes that
   in the earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the
   possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their
   mathematical models.  Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms
   in place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor.
   One mechanism took the form of &lsquo;scram technicians&rsquo;.  These
   individuals stood next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the
   control rods.  Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood
   ready for the (literal) &lsquo;scram&rsquo; command.  If necessary, they
   would cut the cables, and gravity would expeditiously return the control
   rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet another kind of <glossterm>core
   dump</glossterm>.</para>
<!-- from Eric Leif <ericleif@mindspring.com>, 08 Apr 1999 -->

   <para>Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
   held closed by current.  SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
   immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
   insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.</para>

   <para> As in <quote>Before testing or reconfiguring, always mount a
   <glossterm>scratch monkey</glossterm></quote>, a proverb used to advise
   caution when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices.  Used to refer to
   any scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky operation as a
   replacement for some precious resource or data that might otherwise get
   trashed.</para>

   <para>This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey,
   star of a biological research program at the University of Toronto.  Mabel
   was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the university had spent
   years teaching her how to swim, breathing through a regulator, in order to
   study the effects of different gas mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel
   suffered an untimely demise one day when a <glossterm>DEC</glossterm>
   <glossterm>field circus</glossterm> engineer troubleshooting a crash on the
   program's <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> inadvertently interfered with some
   custom hardware that was wired to Mabel.</para>

   <para>It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the <glossterm>field circus</glossterm> manager
   responsible and asked him sweetly, <quote>Can you swim?</quote> Not all the
   consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of the machine in
   question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of certain clueless
   <glossterm>droid</glossterm>s at the local &lsquo;humane&rsquo; society.
   The moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.  [The
   actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of this story,
   complete with reported dialogue between one of the project people and DEC
   field service, that has been circulating on Internet since 1986.  It is
   hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong.  For example, it reports
   the machine as a <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm> and alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC
   <glossterm>PM</glossterm>ed the machine.  Earlier versions of this entry
   were based on that story; this one has been corrected from an interview
   with the hapless sysop. &mdash;ESR]</para>

   <para> [common among Mac users] <glossterm>SCSI</glossterm> interface
   hardware is notoriously fickle of temperament.  Often, the SCSI bus will
   fail to work unless the cable order of devices is re-arranged, SCSI
   termination is added or removed (sometimes double-termination or
   <emphasis>no</emphasis> termination will fix the problem), or particular
   devices are given particular SCSI IDs.  The skills needed to trick the

   <para> (alt.: <emphasis role='firstterm'>security by obscurity</emphasis>)
   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of coping with
   security holes &mdash; namely, ignoring them, documenting neither any known
   holes nor the underlying security algorithms, trusting that nobody will
   find out about them and that people who do find out about them won't
   exploit them.  This <quote>strategy</quote> never works for long and
   occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the
   <glossterm>RTM</glossterm> worm of 1988 (see 
   <glossterm>Great Worm</glossterm>), but once the brief moments of panic created by such
   events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to
   sleep.  After all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources
   needed to implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   &mdash; and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might
   begin to <emphasis>expect</emphasis> it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of <emphasis>right</emphasis> to a
   system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   <emphasis>then</emphasis> where would we be?</para>
</glossdef>
<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet
   newsgroup <systemitem role='newsgroup'>comp.sys.apollo</systemitem> during
   a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its
   Unix-<glossterm>clone</glossterm> Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a
   thing).  <glossterm>ITS</glossterm> fans, on the other hand, say it was
   coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid
   <glossterm>Multics</glossterm> people down the hall, for whom security was
   everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the
   time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over
   the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community; and (2)
   (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of
   many commands.  One instance of <emphasis>deliberate</emphasis> security
   through obscurity is recorded; the command to allow patching the running
   ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D.  If you actually typed
   alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the system even if
   you later got it right.</para>

   Primer</citetitle>, who was one of the original designers of the 8086,
   noted that there was originally a <command remap='code'>SEX</command>
   instruction on that processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold
   feet and decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   <command remap='code'>CBW</command> and <command remap='code'>CWD</command>
   (depending on what was being extended).  Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the
   microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight <command
   remap='code'>SEX</command> but has logical-or and logical-and instructions
   <command remap='code'>ORL</command> and <command
   remap='code'>ANL</command>.</para>

   <para>The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
   U.K.'s &lsquo;Dragon 32&rsquo; personal computer, actually had an official
   <command remap='code'>SEX</command> instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II
   with which it competed did not.  British hackers thought this made perfect
   mythic sense; after all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some
   theoretical level) have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an
   apple.</para>

   <para> [Unix and Usenet; from /bin/sh archive] A
   <glossterm>flatten</glossterm>ed representation of a set of one or more
   files, with the unique property that it can be unflattened (the original
   files restored) by feeding it through a standard Unix shell; thus, a
   sharchive can be distributed to anyone running Unix, and no special
   unpacking software is required.  Sharchives are also intriguing in that
   they are typically created by shell scripts; the script that produces
   sharchives is thus a script which produces self-unpacking scripts, which
   may themselves contain scripts. Sharchives are also commonly referred to as
   &lsquo;shar files&rsquo; after the name of the most common program for
   generating them.</para>

   <para>The downsides of sharchives are that they
   are an ideal venue for <glossterm>Trojan horse</glossterm> attacks and
   that, for recipients not running Unix, no simple un-sharchiving program is
   possible; sharchives can and do make use of arbitrarily-powerful shell
   features. For these reasons, this technique has largely fallen out 
   of use since the mid-1990s. </para>

   <para> [Internet and Usenet; often written &lsquo;.sig&rsquo; there] Short
   for &lsquo;signature&rsquo;, used specifically to refer to the electronic
   signature block that most Unix mail- and news-posting software will
   <glossterm>automagically</glossterm> append to outgoing mail and news.  The
   composition of one's sig can be quite an art form, including an ASCII logo,
   one's choice of witty sayings (see <glossterm>sig quote</glossterm>,
   <glossterm>fool file</glossterm>), or even source code for small programs
   about which the author wishes to make a statement; but many consider large
   sigs a waste of <glossterm>bandwidth</glossterm>, and it has been observed
   that the size of one's sig block is usually inversely proportional to one's
   longevity and level of prestige on the net.  See also

   <para> [Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a computer system,
   used to identify it in email, Usenet, or other forms of electronic
   information interchange.  The folklore interest of sitenames stems from the
   creativity and humor they often display.  Interpreting a sitename is not
   unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally unpack it,
   allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack of whitespace.
   Hacker tradition deprecates dull, institutional-sounding names in favor of
   punchy, humorous, and clever coinages (except that it is considered
   appropriate for the official public gateway machine of an organization to
   bear the organization's name or acronym).  Mythological references, cartoon
   characters, animal names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature are
   probably the most popular sources for sitenames (in roughly descending
   order).  The obligatory comment when discussing these is Harris's Lament:

   <para> 1. A terminal that has enough computing capability to render
   graphics or to offload some kind of front-end processing from the computer

<glossdef>
   <para> [MIT] A unit of length equal five feet seven inches.  The length of
   the Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus an ear (the ear
   is allegedly the width of the earhole in the side of the football helmet
   the victim was wearing when he was rolled over the bridge). This legend
   began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of
   Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that distance.
   It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint every few
   years; the tradition even survived the demolition and rebuilding of the
   bridge in the late 1980s.  The Boston police have been known to use smoot
   markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.  Apparently Smoot's
   experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long career; he
   eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards
   Institute, and later President of the International Organization for
   Standardization.</para>

In the beginning was the plan,
       and then the specification;
And the plan was without form,

And they spake unto their leader,
       saying:
<quote>It is a crock of shit,

And the leader took pity on them,
       and spoke to the project leader:
<quote>It is a crock of excrement,
       and none may abide the odor thereof.</quote>

And the project leader
       spake unto his section head, saying:
<quote>It is a container of excrement,
       and it is very strong, such that none may abide it.</quote>

The section head then hurried to his department manager,
       and informed him thus:
<quote>It is a vessel of fertilizer,
       and none may abide its strength.</quote>

The department manager carried these words
      to his general manager,
and spoke unto him
      saying:
<quote>It containeth that which aideth the growth of plants,
      and it is very strong.</quote>

And so it was that the general manager rejoiced
      and delivered the good news unto the Vice President.
<quote>It promoteth growth,
      and it is very powerful.</quote>

The Vice President rushed to the President's side,
      and joyously exclaimed:

   <para> To replace a pointer to a pointer with a direct pointer; to replace

   the operator may tell you that person's extension before connecting you, in

   line from first to last.  See <glossterm>chase pointers</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Often, the behavior of a <glossterm>trampoline</glossterm> is to

   interface trampoline might check to make sure that the caller is passing
   the correct number of arguments; if it is, and if the caller and the callee
   are both compiled, then snapping the link allows that particular path to
   use a direct procedure-call instruction with no further overhead.</para>

   <para> Term used to describe the tendency of software that has not been
   used in a while to <glossterm>lose</glossterm>; such failure may be
   semi-humorously ascribed to <glossterm>bit rot</glossterm>.  More commonly,
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>software rot</emphasis> strikes when a program's
   assumptions become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently
   <glossterm>robust</glossterm>, this may cause it to fail in mysterious
   ways. Syn. <emphasis role='firstterm'>code rot</emphasis>.  See also
   <glossterm>link rot</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL
   programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their
   2-digit year counters underwent <glossterm>wrap around</glossterm> at the
   beginning of the year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict
   centenarians who have to deal with computer software designed by
   unimaginative clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public
   flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license
   renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system refused to issue the
   card, probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be
   distinguished.</para>
<!-- from Charles Hoequist <hoequist@bnr.ca>, 22 Feb 1991 -->

   <para>Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1;
   see <glossterm>grind crank</glossterm>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user might
   discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once did.
   (<quote>Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such.  We can
   <glossterm>snarf</glossterm> this opcode, right?  No one uses it.</quote>)
   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a
   simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on a
   PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately, this broke some fragile
   timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output out of
   tune.  This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine to
   compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other
   words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected
   appropriately.</para>

   <glossterm>EMACS</glossterm>.  It was equipped with no fewer than
   <emphasis>seven</emphasis> shift keys: four keys for <glossterm>bucky
   bits</glossterm> (&lsquo;control&rsquo;, &lsquo;meta&rsquo;,
   &lsquo;hyper&rsquo;, and &lsquo;super&rsquo;) and three regular shift keys,
   called &lsquo;shift&rsquo;, &lsquo;top&rsquo;, and &lsquo;front&rsquo;.
   Many keys had three symbols on them: a letter and a symbol on the top, and
   a Greek letter on the front.  For example, the &lsquo;L&rsquo; key had an
   &lsquo;L&rsquo; and a two-way arrow on the top, and the Greek letter lambda
   on the front.  By pressing this key with the right hand while playing an
   appropriate &lsquo;chord&rsquo; with the left hand on the shift keys, you
   could get the following results:</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols='2'>
<tbody>
<row><entry>L               </entry><entry>lowercase l</entry></row>
<row><entry>shift-L         </entry><entry>uppercase L</entry></row>
<row><entry>front-L         </entry><entry>&lambda;</entry></row>
<row><entry>front-shift-L   </entry><entry>&Lambda;</entry></row>
<row><entry>top-L           </entry><entry>&hArr; (front and shift are ignored)</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>

   <para>And of course each of these might also be typed with any combination
   of the control, meta, hyper, and super keys.  On this keyboard, you could
   type over 8000 different characters!  This allowed the user to type very
   complicated mathematical text, and also to have thousands of
   single-character commands at his disposal.  The keyboard of the Symbolics
   Lisp machine was a simplified version, lacking Top and Front keys, that
   could only send about 2000 characters.</para>

   <para>Many hackers were actually willing to memorize the command meanings
   of that many characters if it reduced typing time (this attitude obviously
   shaped the interface of EMACS).  Other hackers, however, thought having
   that many bucky bits was overkill, and objected that such a keyboard can
   require three or four hands to operate.  See <glossterm>bucky
   bits</glossterm>, <glossterm>cokebottle</glossterm>, <glossterm>double
   bucky</glossterm>, <glossterm>meta bit</glossterm>, <glossterm>quadruple

   <para> [poss. by analogy to sunblock] Text inserted in an email address to
   render it invalid and thus useless to spammers.  For example, the address
   <email>jrandom@hacker.org</email> might be transformed to
   <email>jrandom@NOSPAM.hacker.org</email>.  Adding spamblock to an address
   is often referred to as <emphasis role='firstterm'>munging</emphasis> it
   (see <glossterm>munge</glossterm>).  This evasion tactic depends on the
   fact that most spammers collect names with some sort of <glossterm>address

   individual humans reading an email message can readily spot and remove a
   spamblock in the From address.</para>

   <para>Note: This is not actually a very effective tactic, and may already
   be passing out of use in early 1999 after about two years of life.  In both
   mail and news, it's essentially impossible to keep a smart address
   harvester from mining out the addresses in the message header and trace
   lines.  Therefore the only people who can be protected are third parties
   mentioned by email address in the message &mdash; not a common enough case
   to interest spammers.</para>

   several industries; telephone engineers refer to spiking a relay by
   inserting a pin to hold the relay in either the closed or open state, and
   railroaders refer to spiking a track switch so that it cannot be moved.  In
   programming environments it normally refers to a temporary change, usually

   <para> 1. A lower form of life found on <glossterm>talker
   system</glossterm>s and <glossterm>MUD</glossterm>s.  The spod has few
   friends in <glossterm>RL</glossterm> and uses talkers instead, finding
   communication easier and preferable over the net.  He has all the negative
   traits of the computer geek without having any interest in computers per
   se.  Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and
   considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to
   sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following
   passed-on instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet (<quote>Wow!
   It's in America!</quote>) and complaining when he is not allowed to use
   busy routes.  A true spod will start any conversation with <quote>Are you
   male or female?</quote> (and follow it up with <quote>Got any good
   numbers/IDs/passwords?</quote>) and will not talk to someone physically
   present in the same terminal room until they log onto the same machine that
   he is using and enter talk mode.  2.  An experienced talker user.  As with
   the defiant adoption of the term geek in the mid-1990s by people who would
   previously have been stigmatized by it, the term <quote>spod</quote> is now
   used as a mark of distinction by talker users who've accumulated a large
   amount of login time. Such spods tend to be very knowledgeable about
   talkers and talker coding, as well as more general hacker activites. An
   unusually high proportion of spods work in the ISP sector, a profession
   which allows for lengthy periods of login time and for under-the-desk
   servers, or <quote>spodhosts</quote>, upon which talker systems are

   <para> The set of things a person has to do in the future.  One speaks of
   the next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack.
   <quote>I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed
   way down on my stack.</quote> <quote>I haven't done it yet because every
   time I pop my stack something new gets pushed.</quote> If you are
   interrupted several times in the middle of a conversation, <quote>My stack
   overflowed</quote> means <quote>I forget what we were talking
   about.</quote> The implication is that more items were pushed onto the
   stack than could be remembered, so the least recent items were lost.  The
   usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a cafeteria: a pile of
   plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so that when you put one on
   the top they all sink down, and when you take one off the top the rest
   spring up a bit.  See also <glossterm>push</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>pop</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> [scientific computing] Said of a sequence of memory reads and writes

   These can be a worst-case access pattern for the standard memory-caching
   schemes when the stride length is a multiple of the cache line size.
   Strided references are often generated by loops through an array, and (if
   your data is large enough that access-time is significant) it can be
   worthwhile to tune for better locality by inverting double loops or by
   partially unrolling the outer loop of a loop nest.  This usage is
   borderline techspeak; the related term <emphasis role='firstterm'>memory
   stride</emphasis> is definitely techspeak.</para>

Abstract:
        This study examined the incidence of neckwear tightness among a group
of 94 white-collar working men and the effect of a tight business-shirt collar
and tie on the visual performance of 22 male subjects.  Of the white-collar
men measured, 67% were found to be wearing neckwear that was tighter than
their neck circumference.  The visual discrimination of the 22 subjects was
evaluated using a critical flicker frequency (CFF) test.  Results of the CFF
test indicated that tight neckwear significantly decreased the visual
performance of the subjects and that visual performance did not improve
immediately when tight neckwear was removed.

   <para> Sun Microsystems.  Hackers remember that the name was originally an
   acronym, Stanford University Network.  Sun started out around 1980 with
   some hardware hackers (mainly) from Stanford talking to some software
   hackers (mainly) from UC Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept
   married a clever board design based on the Motorola 68000 to
   <glossterm>BSD</glossterm> Unix.  Sun went on to lead the workstation
   industry through the 1980s, and for years afterwards remained an
   engineering-driven company and a good place for hackers to work.  Though
   Sun drifted away from its techie origins after 1990 and has since made some
   strategic moves that disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by
   maintaining proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still
   considered within the family in much the same way
   <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> was in the 1970s and early 1980s.</para>

   <para> A prolific programmer; one who can code exceedingly well and
   quickly.  Not all hackers are superprogrammers, but many are.
   (Productivity can vary from one programmer to another by three orders of
   magnitude.  For example, one programmer might be able to write an average
   of 3 lines of working code in one day, while another, with the proper
   tools, might be able to write 3,000.  This range is astonishing; it is
   matched in very few other areas of human endeavor.)  The term <emphasis

   such places as IBM than in the hacker community.  It tends to stress naive
   measures of productivity and to underweight creativity, ingenuity, and
   getting the job <emphasis>done</emphasis> &mdash; and to sidestep the
   question of whether the 3,000 lines of code do more or less useful work

   the <glossterm>Perl</glossterm> scripting language as a <quote>Swiss-Army
   chainsaw</quote>, intending to convey his evaluation of the language as
   exceedingly powerful but ugly and noisy and prone to belch noxious fumes.
   This had two results: (1) Perl fans adopted the epithet as a badge of
   pride, and (2) it entered more general usage to describe software that is
   highly versatile but distressingly inelegant.</para>

   <para> The opposite of <glossterm>syntactic sugar</glossterm>, a feature
   designed to make it harder to write bad code.  Specifically, syntactic salt
   is a hoop the programmer must jump through just to prove that he knows
   what's going on, rather than to express a program action.  Some programmers
   consider required type declarations to be syntactic salt.  A requirement to
   write <command remap='code'>end if</command>, <command remap='code'>end
   while</command>, <command remap='code'>end do</command>, etc.: to terminate
   the last block controlled by a control construct (as opposed to just
   <command remap='code'>end</command>) would definitely be syntactic salt.
   Syntactic salt is like the real thing in that it tends to raise hackers'
   blood pressures in an unhealthy way.  Compare
   <glossterm>candygrammar</glossterm>.</para>

   wants coffee; but of course he will be brought a cup of tea instead.

   <para> A feature supported by Unix and some other OSes that allows
   two or more logged-in users to set up a real-time on-line conversation.  It
   combines the immediacy of talking with all the precision (and verbosity)
   that written language entails.  It is difficult to communicate inflection,
   though conventions have arisen for some of these (see the section on
   writing style in the Prependices for details).</para>

   <para>Talk mode has a special set of jargon words, used to save typing,
   which are not used orally.  Some of these are identical to (and probably
   derived from) Morse-code jargon used by ham-radio amateurs since the

   <para>Most of these are not used at universities or in the Unix
   world, though ROTF and TTFN have gained some currency there and IMHO is
   common; conversely, most of the people who know these are unfamiliar with
   FOO?, BCNU, HELLOP, <glossterm>NIL</glossterm>, and
   <glossterm>T</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>The <glossterm>MUD</glossterm> community uses a mixture of
   Usenet/Internet emoticons, a few of the more natural of the old-style
   talk-mode abbrevs, and some of the &lsquo;social&rsquo; list above;
   specifically, MUD respondents report use of BBL, BRB, LOL, b4, BTW, WTF,
   TTFN, and WTH.  The use of <emphasis role='firstterm'>rehi</emphasis> is
   also common; in fact, mudders are fond of re- compounds and will frequently
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>rehug</emphasis> or <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>rebonk</emphasis> (see <glossterm>bonk/oif</glossterm>)
   people.  The word <emphasis role='firstterm'>re</emphasis> by itself is
   taken as &lsquo;regreet&rsquo;.  In general, though, MUDders express a
   preference for typing things out in full rather than using abbreviations;
   this may be due to the relative youth of the MUD cultures, which tend to
   include many touch typists and to assume high-speed links.  The following
   uses specific to MUDs are reported:</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols='2'>
<tbody>
<row><entry>CU l8er</entry><entry>see you later (mutant of <command remap='code'>CU l8tr</command>)</entry></row>
<row><entry>FOAD</entry><entry>fuck off and die (use of this is generally OTT)</entry></row>
<row><entry>OTT</entry><entry>over the top (excessive, uncalled for)</entry></row>
<row><entry>ppl</entry><entry>abbrev for <quote>people</quote></entry></row>
<row><entry>THX</entry><entry>thanks (mutant of <command remap='code'>TNX</command>; clearly this comes in batches of 1138 (the
Lucasian K)).</entry></row>
<row><entry>UOK?</entry><entry>are you OK?</entry></row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>

   <para>Some <glossterm>B1FF</glossterm>isms (notably the variant spelling
   <command remap='code'>d00d</command>) appear to be passing into wider use
   among some subgroups of MUDders.</para>

   <para>One final note on talk mode style: neophytes, when in talk mode,
   often seem to think they must produce letter-perfect prose because they are
   typing rather than speaking.  This is not the best approach.  It can be
   very frustrating to wait while your partner pauses to think of a word, or
   repeatedly makes the same spelling error and backs up to fix it.  It is
   usually best just to leave typographical errors behind and plunge forward,
   unless severe confusion may result; in that case it is often fastest just
   to type <quote>xxx</quote> and start over from before the mistake.</para>

   <para>sorts them alphabetically according to surname, and then puts the

   <para>In fact, this very program was used to produce the second, sorted

   that <command remap='code'>^P</command> means &lsquo;sort&rsquo; and
   <command remap='code'>J&lt;.-Z; &ellipsis; L&gt;</command> is an idiomatic
   series of commands for &lsquo;do once for every line&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>An extremely powerful <glossterm>macro</glossterm>-based text
   formatter written by Donald E. <glossterm>Knuth</glossterm>, very popular
   in the computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix
   <glossterm>troff</glossterm>, the other favored formatter, even at many
   Unix installations).  TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural)
   pronunciation, and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with
   the E depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case &lsquo;TeX&rsquo; is
   considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices).  Fans like to
   proliferate names from the word &lsquo;TeX&rsquo; &mdash; such as TeXnician
   (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX
   programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.  See also
   <glossterm>CrApTeX</glossterm>.</para>

   <para>Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
   quality of the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental
   <citetitle>Art of Computer Programming</citetitle> (see
   <glossterm>Knuth</glossterm>, also <glossterm>bible</glossterm>).  In a
   manifestation of the typical hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once
   and for all, he began to design his own typesetting language.  He thought
   he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8
   years.  The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of
   <citetitle>The Art of Computer Programming</citetitle> is not expected to
   appear until 2007.  The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such
   that nobody minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have started
   as a bit of <glossterm>toolsmith</glossterm>ing on the way to something
   else; Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.</para>

   <para>TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found
   and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years
   wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to
   find), the bribe went up.  Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so
   full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least
   one bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.</para>

   possibly handle the event is awakened.  In the end, only one of those
   processes will actually be able to do the work, but, in the meantime, all
   the others wake up and contend for CPU time before being put back to
   sleep. Thus the system thrashes briefly while a herd of processes thunders
   through. If this starts to happen many times per second, the performance
   impact can be significant.</para>

   data hitting an accumulator.  Yet another suggests that it is the sound of
   the expression being unfrozen at argument-evaluation time.  In fact,
   according to the inventors, it was coined after they realized (in the wee
   hours after hours of discussion) that the type of an argument in Algol-60
   could be figured out in advance with a little compile-time thought,
   simplifying the evaluation machinery.  In other words, it had

   <para>[now primarily historical] Timesharing is the technique of scheduling
   a computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and
   multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her
   computation is going on continuously.  John McCarthy, the inventor of
   <glossterm>LISP</glossterm>, first <ulink
   url="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html">imagined
   this technique</ulink> in the late 1950s.  The first timesharing operating
   systems, BBN's "Little Hospital" and <glossterm>CTSS</glossterm>, were
   deplayed in 1962-63.  The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew
   up around the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers,
   notably the <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> 10, 11, and <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> lines.  But these
   were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit less powerful than
   today's personal computers, they had to be shared by dozens or even
   hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities nucleated around
   places where it was relatively easy to get access to a timesharing
   account.</para>
 
   <para>Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important 
   constraint on what you can do with your computer.  Not so back then;
   timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not uncommon 
   for everyone's work to grind to a halt while the machine scheduler
   thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next.  Early hacker slang
   was replete with terms like <emphasis role='firstterm'>cycle
   crunch</emphasis> and <emphasis role='firstterm'>cycle drought</emphasis>
   for describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread
   among too many users.  As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced
   the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.</para>

   <para>One reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the
   earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;
   they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal
   with many of the same problems with respect to it.  A system crash could
   idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room and
   with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation
   resumed.</para>
   
   <para>Timesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities
   runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally
   available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more control
   over their programming environment began to migrate off timesharing
   machines and onto what are now called <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>workstations</emphasis> around 1983.  It took another ten
   years, the development of powerful 32-bit personal micros, the
   <glossterm>Great Internet Explosion</glossterm> before the migration was
   complete.  It is no coincidence that the last stages of this migration
   coincided with the development of the first open-source operating
   systems.</para>

   <para> The Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT, one of the wellsprings of
   hacker culture.  The 1959 <citetitle>Dictionary of the TMRC
   Language</citetitle> compiled by Peter Samson included several terms that
   became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see
   esp. <glossterm>foo</glossterm>, <glossterm>mung</glossterm>, and
   <glossterm>frob</glossterm>).</para>

   <para>By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   and has grown in the years since. All the features described here were
   still present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before
   the demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained
   when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003).  The control system
   alone featured about 1200 relays.  There were <glossterm>scram
   switch</glossterm>es located at numerous places around the room that could
   be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train
   going full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a
   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder
   in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays.  When
   someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced
   with the word &lsquo;FOO&rsquo;; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore
   called <emphasis role='firstterm'>foo switches</emphasis>.</para>

   <para>Steven Levy, in his book <citetitle>Hackers</citetitle> (see the
   <link linkend='bibliography'>Bibliography</link> in Appendix C), gives a
   stimulating account of those early years.  TMRC's Signals and Power
   Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later
   became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that
   connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes
   a number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.</para>

   &lsquo;toolkit&rsquo; in that the former implies a collection of
   semi-independent tools with complementary functions, while
   &lsquo;toolchain&rsquo; implies that each of the parts is a serial stage in
   a rather tightly bound pipeline.  Seems to have become current in early
   1999 and 2000; now common.</para>

<glossdef>
   <para> [common] To put the newly-added portion of an email or Usenet
   response before the quoted part, as opposed to the more logical sequence of
   quoted portion first with original following.  The problem with this
   practice is neatly summed up by the following FAQ entry:</para>

<screen>
A: No.
Q: Should I include quotations after my reply?
</screen>

   <para>This term is generally used pejoratively with the implication that
   the offending person is a <glossterm>newbie</glossterm>, a Microsoft addict
   (Microsoft mail tools produce a similar format by default), or simply a
   common-and-garden-variety idiot.</para>

   <para>One major problem with top-posting is that people who do it all too
   frequently quote the <emphasis>entire</emphasis> parent message rather than
   trimming it down to those portions relevent to their reply &mdash; this
   makes threads bulky and unnecessarily difficult to read and arouses the
   righteous ire of experienced Internet residents (this style is called
   <quote>TOFU</quote> for <quote>text over, fullquote under</quote>, or
   sometimes <quote>jeopardy-style quoting</quote>).  Another problem is that
   top-posters often word their replies on the assumption that you just read
   the previous message, even though their perversity has put it further down
   the page than you have yet read. Oppose
   <glossterm>bottom-post</glossterm>.</para>

   <para> Term used on GEnie, Usenet and other electronic fora to describe the
   tendency of a <glossterm>thread</glossterm> to drift away from the original
   subject of discussion (and thus, from the Subject header of the originating
   message), or the results of that tendency.  The header in each post can be
   changed to keep current with the posts, but usually isn't due to
   forgetfulness or laziness.  A single post may often result in several posts
   each responding to a different point in the original.  Some subthreads will
   actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side comment, possibly
   degenerating into a <glossterm>flame war</glossterm>, or just as often
   evolving into a separate discussion.  Hence, discussions aren't really so
   much threads as they are trees.  Except that they don't really have leaves,
   or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of discussion will just
   sort of die off after everyone gets tired of them.  This could take
   anywhere from hours to weeks, or even longer.</para>

   <para>The term &lsquo;topic drift&rsquo; is often used in gentle reminders
   that the discussion has strayed off any useful track.  <quote>I think we
   started with a question about Niven's last book, but we've ended up
   discussing the sexual habits of the common marmoset.  Now
   <emphasis>that's</emphasis> topic drift!</quote></para>

   <para> [Unix] The gray eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and
   phototypesetting program, written originally in <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm> assembler and then
   in barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after the
   earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after the
   <glossterm>Multics</glossterm> and <glossterm>CTSS</glossterm> program
   RUNOFF by Jerome Saltzer (<emphasis>that</emphasis> name came from the
   expression <quote>to run off a copy</quote>).  A companion program,
   <application>nroff</application>, formats output for terminals and line
   printers.</para>

   <para>In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
   phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.  His paper describing
   that work (<quote>A Typesetter-independent troff,</quote> AT&amp;T CSTR
   #97) explains troff's durability.  After discussing the program's
   <quote>obvious deficiencies &mdash; a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious
   and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite for
   computer resources</quote> and noting the ugliness and extreme hairiness of
   the code and internals, Kernighan concludes:</para>

<blockquote remap='quotation'>
<para>None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating
Ossanna's accomplishment with TROFF.  It has proven a
remarkably robust tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a
variety of preprocessors and being forced into uses that
were never conceived of in the original design, all with
considerable grace under fire.</para>
</blockquote>

   <para>The success of <glossterm>TeX</glossterm> and desktop publishing
   systems have reduced <command remap='code'>troff</command>'s relative
   importance, but this tribute perfectly captures the strengths that secured
   <command remap='code'>troff</command> a place in hacker folklore; indeed,
   it could be taken more generally as an indication of those qualities of
   good programs that, in the long run, hackers most admire.</para>

   showing that all machines and languages capable of expressing a certain
   very primitive set of operations are logically equivalent in the kinds of
   computations they can carry out, and in principle have capabilities that
   differ only in speed from those of the most powerful and elegantly designed
   computers.  However, no machine or language exactly matching Turing's
   primitive set has ever been built (other than possibly as a classroom
   exercise), because it would be horribly slow and far too painful to use.  A

   postings</ulink>.  Linus explained that he was once bitten by a killer
   penguin in Australia and has felt a special affinity for the species ever

   McGraw, the evil-genius penguin jewel thief who appeared in a Wallace &amp;

   <para>Larry Ewing <ulink url='http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/'>
   designed</ulink> the official Tux logo.  It has proved a wise choice,
   amenable to hundreds of recognizable variations used as emblems of
   Linux-related projects, products, and user groups. In fact, Tux has spawned
   an entire mythology, of which the <ulink

   <para> The TOPS-20 operating system by <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> &mdash;
   the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 &mdash; preferred by most PDP-10
   hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   <glossterm>ITS</glossterm> or <glossterm>WAITS</glossterm> partisans).
   TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman's TENEX operating
   system using special paging hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of
   the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX
   from BBN and began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name
   for the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when
   customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC
   could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS.  When the
   name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS;
   this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>krans</emphasis> meant &lsquo;funeral wreath&rsquo; in
   Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   &lsquo;wreath&rsquo;; this part of the story may be apocryphal).
   Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it
   was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its
   origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of &lsquo;twenty
   TENEX&rsquo;), even though by this point very little of the original TENEX
   code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&amp;T V6 Unix and
   BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard <quote>TWENEX</quote>, but the
   term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation &lsquo;20x&rsquo; was
   also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a
   period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of
   partisans as Unix or ITS &mdash; but DEC's decision to scrap all the
   internal rivals to the <glossterm>VAX</glossterm> architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's
   brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert
   to <glossterm>VMS</glossterm>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the
   TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.  There is a <ulink

   interactive timesharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell
   Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play games on his
   scavenged PDP-7.  Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a
   co-author of the system.  The turning point in Unix's history came when it
   was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972&mdash;1974, making it
   the first source-portable OS.  Unix subsequently underwent mutations and
   expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely
   flexible and developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the
   most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world
   &mdash; and since 1996 the variant called <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> has
   been at the cutting edge of the <glossterm>open source</glossterm>
   movement.  Many people consider the success of Unix the most important
   victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see <glossterm>Unix

   opposing point of view).  See <glossterm>Version 7</glossterm>,

   <para>Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately
   &lsquo;UNIX&rsquo; or &lsquo;Unix&rsquo;; both forms are common, and used
   interchangeably.  Dennis Ritchie says that the &lsquo;UNIX&rsquo; spelling
   originally happened in CACM's 1974 paper <citetitle>The UNIX Time-Sharing
   System</citetitle> because <quote>we had a new typesetter and
   <glossterm>troff</glossterm> had just been invented and we were intoxicated
   by being able to produce small caps.</quote> Later, dmr tried to get the
   spelling changed to &lsquo;Unix&rsquo; in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
   the grounds that the word is not acronymic.  He failed, and eventually (his
   words) <quote>wimped out</quote> on the issue.  So, while the trademark
   today is &lsquo;UNIX&rsquo;, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient
   usage; the Jargon File uses &lsquo;Unix&rsquo; in deference to dmr's
   wishes.</para>

   <para> [ITS] According to a conspiracy theory long popular among
   <glossterm>ITS</glossterm> and <glossterm>TOPS-20</glossterm> fans, Unix's
   growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs,
   whose intent was to hobble AT&amp;T's competitors by making them dependent
   upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T's control.
   This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is
   apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable
   and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&amp;T).  This
   theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper referenced in
   the <glossterm>back door</glossterm> entry.</para>

   <para>In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer
   viruses (see <glossterm>virus</glossterm>) &mdash; but a virus spread to
   computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this &lsquo;Unix virus&rsquo;
   theory like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation <quote>Unix is
   snake oil</quote> was uttered by <glossterm>DEC</glossterm> president
   Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting its own family of
   Unix workstations.  (Olsen now claims to have been misquoted.)</para>

   <para>If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
   plotters' control after 1990.  AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to Novell
   around the same time <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> and other free-Unix
   distributions were beginning to make noise.</para>

   <para>By the year the Internet hit the mainstream (1994) the original UUCP
   transport for Usenet was fading out of use &mdash; almost all Usenet
   connections were over Internet links.  A lot of newbies and journalists
   began to refer to <quote>Internet newsgroups</quote> as though Usenet was
   and always had been just another Internet service.  This ignorance greatly
   annoys experienced Usenetters.</para>

   <para>The general theory behind this term is that there are two classes of
   people who work with a program: there are implementors (hackers) and
   <glossterm>luser</glossterm>s.  The users are looked down on by hackers to
   some extent because they don't understand the full ramifications of the
   system in all its glory.  (The few users who do are known as <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>real winners</emphasis>.)  The term is a relative one: a
   skilled hacker may be a user with respect to some program he himself does
   not hack.  A LISP hacker might be one who maintains LISP or one who uses
   LISP (but with the skill of a hacker).  A LISP user is one who uses LISP,
   whether skillfully or not.  Thus there is some overlap between the two
   terms; the subtle distinctions must be resolved by context.</para>

   <para>This object is historically one of the first complex 3D models to be
   rendered in computer graphics. It consisted of about 110 vertices, and was
   generated by Martin Newell in 1974 using hand-drawn Bezier curves, based on
   a real teapot that he and his wife had bought. This model served as a basis
   for comparing various 3D rendering methodologies for lighting, textures,
   bump-mapping, etc. By the standards of 2002, the model is trivial to render
   and thus is often not suited to demonstrate the complexity of modern
   research.  Despite this, the tea pot still appears, now and then, in recent
   papers. More on the teapot's history lives at <ulink

   Wars</citetitle>) &mdash; analogous to <glossterm>RTFS</glossterm> (sense

   <glossterm>wizard</glossterm>s to answer them.</para>

   <para>Once upon a time in <glossterm>elder days</glossterm>, everyone
   running Unix had source.  After 1978, AT&amp;T's policy tightened up, so
   this objurgation was in theory appropriately directed only at associates of
   some outfit with a Unix source license.  In practice, bootlegs of Unix
   source code (made precisely for reference purposes) were so ubiquitous that
   one could utter it at almost anyone on the network without concern.</para>

   <para>Nowadays, free Unix clones have become widely enough distributed that
   anyone can read source legally.  The most widely distributed is certainly
   Linux, with variants of the NET/2 and 4.4BSD distributions running second.
   Cheap commercial Unixes with source such as BSD/OS are accelerating this
   trend.</para>

   <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>.  Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse
   by <glossterm>killer micro</glossterm>s after about 1986, the VAX was

   for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set &mdash; an
   asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution.</para>

   <para>It is worth noting that the standard plural of VAX was

   <para> 2. A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain.  Cited here because
   its sales pitch, <quote>Nothing sucks like a VAX!</quote> became a sort of
   battle-cry of RISC partisans.  It is even sometimes claimed that DEC
   actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that
   allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not
   challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S.</para>

   <para>A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was
   <quote>Nothing sucks like Electrolux</quote>.  It has apparently become a
   classic example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not
   knowing the local idiom.  But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB,
   while confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s, also
   tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the possible
   double entendre and intended it to gain attention.</para>

   <para>And gain attention it did &mdash; the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people
   thought the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it.  Several British
   hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we have one
   report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan surfaced there in TV
   ads for the product in 1992.</para>

   <para> [analogy with &lsquo;ethnocentrism&rsquo;] A notional disease said
   to afflict C programmers who persist in coding according to certain
   assumptions that are valid (esp. under Unix) on
   <glossterm>VAXen</glossterm> but false elsewhere. Among these are:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that dereferencing a null pointer is safe because it is all
bits 0, and location 0 is readable and 0.  Problem: this may instead cause an
illegal-address trap on non-VAXen, and even on VAXen under OSes other than BSD
Unix.  Usually this is an implicit assumption of sloppy code (forgetting to
check the pointer before using it), rather than deliberate exploitation of a
misfeature.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that characters are signed.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that a pointer to any one type can freely be cast into a
pointer to any other type.  A stronger form of this is the assumption that all
pointers are the same size and format, which means you don't have to worry
about getting the casts or types correct in calls.  Problem: this fails on
word-oriented machines or others with multiple pointer formats.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that the parameters of a routine are stored in memory, on a
stack, contiguously, and in strictly ascending or descending order.  Problem:
this fails on many RISC architectures.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that pointer and integer types are the same size, and that
pointers can be stuffed into integer variables (and vice-versa) and drawn back
out without being truncated or mangled.  Problem: this fails on segmented
architectures or word-oriented machines with funny pointer formats.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that a data type of any size may begin at any byte address in
memory (for example, that you can freely construct and dereference a pointer
to a word- or greater-sized object at an odd char address).  Problem: this
fails on many (esp. RISC) architectures better optimized for
<glossterm>HLL</glossterm> execution speed, and can cause an illegal address
fault or bus error.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The (related) assumption that there is no padding at the end of types and that
in an array you can thus step right from the last byte of a previous component
to the first byte of the next one.  This is not only machine- but
compiler-dependent.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that memory address space is globally flat and that the array
reference <command remap='code'>foo[-1]</command> is necessarily valid.
Problem: this fails at 0, or other places on segment-addressed machines like
Intel chips (yes, segmentation is universally considered a
<glossterm>brain-damaged</glossterm> way to design machines (see
<glossterm>moby</glossterm>), but that is a separate issue).
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that objects can be arbitrarily large with no special
considerations.  Problem: this fails on segmented architectures and under
non-virtual-addressing environments.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that the stack can be as large as memory.  Problem: this fails
on segmented architectures or almost anything else without virtual addressing
and a paged stack.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that bits and addressable units within an object are ordered in
the same way and that this order is a constant of nature.  Problem: this fails
on <glossterm>big-endian</glossterm> machines.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that it is meaningful to compare pointers to different objects
not located within the same array, or to objects of different types.  Problem:
the former fails on segmented architectures, the latter on word-oriented
machines or others with multiple pointer formats.  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that an <type>int</type> is 32 bits, or (nearly equivalently)
the assumption that <command remap='code'>sizeof(int) ==
sizeof(long)</command>.  Problem: this fails on <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>s, 286-based systems and
even on 386 and 68000 systems under some compilers (and on 64-bit systems like
the Alpha, of course).  </para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
The assumption that <command remap='code'>argv[]</command> is
writable. Problem: this fails in many embedded-systems C environments and even
under a few flavors of Unix.  </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

   <para>Note that a programmer can validly be accused of vaxocentrism even if
   he or she has never seen a <glossterm>VAX</glossterm>.  Some of these
   assumptions (esp. 2--5) were valid on the <glossterm>PDP-11</glossterm>,
   the original C machine, and became endemic years before the VAX.  The terms
   <emphasis role='firstterm'>vaxocentricity</emphasis> and <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>all-the-world's-a-VAX syndrome</emphasis> have been used
   synonymously.</para>

   <para>An interesting variant of the vdiff technique usable by anyone who
   has sufficient control over the parallax of their eyeballs (e.g. those who
   can easily view random-dot stereograms), is to hold up two paper printouts
   and go cross-eyed to superimpose them.  This invokes deep, fast, built-in
   image comparison wetware (the same machinery responsible for depth
   perception) and differences stand out almost immediately.  This technique
   is good for finding edits in graphical images, or for comparing an image
   with a compressed version to spot artifacts.</para>

   <para> [from the obvious analogy with biological viruses, via SF] A cracker
   program that searches out other programs and &lsquo;infects&rsquo; them by
   embedding a copy of itself in them, so that they become <glossterm>Trojan
   horse</glossterm>s.  When these programs are executed, the embedded virus
   is executed too, thus propagating the &lsquo;infection&rsquo;.  This
   normally happens invisibly to the user.  Unlike a
   <glossterm>worm</glossterm>, a virus cannot infect other computers without
   assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs
   with their friends (see <glossterm>SEX</glossterm>).  The virus may do
   nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally.
   Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing
   things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks
   with the display (some viruses include nice <glossterm>display
   hack</glossterm>s).  Many nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely
   minded <glossterm>cracker</glossterm>s, do irreversible damage, like nuking
   all the user's files.</para>

   <para>In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among
   Windows users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to
   spread easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by
   contrast, are immune to such attacks).  The production of special
   anti-virus software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated
   media reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many
   <glossterm>luser</glossterm>s tend to blame <emphasis>everything</emphasis>
   that doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks.  Accordingly, this
   sense of <emphasis role='firstterm'>virus</emphasis> has passed not only
   into techspeak but into also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly

   <para> Pejorative hackerism for VB.NET (Visual Basic for the .NET

   the previous Visual Basic on its .NET framework, but VB.NET is really just
   C# with a slightly different syntax and fewer libraries.  Migrating
   existing code from Visual Basic to VB.NET is generally impractical because
   VB.NET has a large number of unnecessary incompatibilities with Visual
   Basic.  Since VB.NET has essentially nothing to do with Visual Basic, a

   <para> The mutant cousin of <glossterm>TOPS-10</glossterm> used on a

   never an &lsquo;official&rsquo; expansion of WAITS (the name itself having
   been arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently
   glossed as &lsquo;West-coast Alternative to ITS&rsquo;.  Though WAITS was
   less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas
   between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted
   enormous indirect influence.  The early screen modes of
   <glossterm>EMACS</glossterm>, for example, were directly inspired by
   WAITS's &lsquo;E&rsquo; editor &mdash; one of a family of editors that were
   the first to do &lsquo;real-time editing&rsquo;, in which the editing
   commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of
   insertion/overwriting.  The modern style of multi-region windowing is said
   to have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere
   played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star, the
   Macintosh, and the Sun workstations.  Also invented there were
   <glossterm>bucky bits</glossterm> &mdash; thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC
   is a WAITS legacy.  One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a
   news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter
   AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also featured a
   still-unusual level of support for what is now called <emphasis

   whole width of the disk, followed by a slow seek in the other direction).
   Some bands of old-time hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing
   patterns that would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive
   races.</para>

<glossdef role='history'>
   <para>Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the people
   who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in <glossterm>larval
   stage</glossterm>, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious
   and unaffected by models known in popular culture &mdash; communities
   formed spontaneously around people who, <emphasis>as
   individuals</emphasis>, felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and
   what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to
   become similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;
   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included
   the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is
   that some people semi-consciously set out to <emphasis>be
   hackers</emphasis> and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image
   of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually
   become a wizard.  Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly
   articulated disquiet about the change; among other things, it gives them
   mixed feelings about the effects of public compendia of lore like this
   one.</para>

Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software.  If
it has copy protection on it, they break the protection so
the software can be copied.  Then they distribute it around
the world via several gateways.  Warez d00dz form badass
group names like RAZOR and the like.  They put up boards
that distribute the latest ware, or pirate program.  The
whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the pirate
program released and distributed before any other group.  I
know, I know.  But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much.
This is how they prove their poweress [sic].  It gives them
the right to say, <quote>I released King's Quest IVXIX before you

   <emphasis role='firstterm'>0-day warez</emphasis>, that is copies of
   commercial software copied and cracked on the same day as its retail
   release.  Warez d00ds also hoard software in a big way, collecting untold
   megabytes of arcade-style games, pornographic JPGs, and applications
   they'll never use onto their hard disks.  As Ozone Pilot acutely
   observes:</para>

   <blockquote remap='quotation'><para>[BELONG] is the only word you will need
   to know.  Warez d00dz want to belong.  They have been shunned by everyone,
   and thus turn to cyberspace for acceptance.  That is why they always start
   groups like TGW, FLT, USA and the like.  Structure makes them happy. [...]
   Warez d00dz will never have a handle like <quote>Pink Daisy</quote> because
   warez d00dz are insecure.  Only someone who is very secure with a good dose
   of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man.  More
   likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death, Deranged
   Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown, Renegade Chemist,
   Terminator, and Twin Turbo.  They like to sound badass when they can hide
   behind their terminals.  More likely, if you were given a sample of 100
   people, the person whose handle is Hellraiser is the last person you'd
   associate with the name.</para></blockquote>

   <para>[from the Lojban-language list] Software designs are often restricted
   in unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware
   they have to work with.  Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways by
   mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or
   environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded.  When a
   design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that is
   no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian mind-lock. The
   design itself has been &lsquo;whorfed&rsquo;.</para>

   <para>For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that
   directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories;
   therefore directories must be kept small.  Another common way to succumb to
   Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working set
   rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory; the
   hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and virtual
   memory works poorly if at all.  Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is important,
   because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and bugs.</para>

   <para> The central monster (and, in many versions, the name) of a famous
   family of very early computer games called <citetitle>Hunt The
   Wumpus</citetitle>.  The original was invented in 1970 (several years
   before <glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm>) by Gregory Yob.  The wumpus lived
   somewhere in a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex
   graph (later versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron
   and M&ouml;bius strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave
   with five &lsquo;crooked arrows&rsquo;; these could be shot through up to
   three connected rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions
   introduced the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for
   players, the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not
   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him) but also
   by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would pick you up and
   drop you at a random location (later versions added &lsquo;anaerobic
   termites&rsquo; that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that
   randomly changed pit locations).</para>

   <para>This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even older
   Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting and its
   terse, amusing messages, it prefigured <glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm> and
   <glossterm>Zork</glossterm> and was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork
   acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony).  A C emulation
   of the original Basic game is available at the Retrocomputing Museum,

   <para> Describes a user interface under which <quote>What You See Is
   <emphasis>All</emphasis> You Get</quote>; an unhappy variant of
   <glossterm>WYSIWYG</glossterm>.  Visual,
   &lsquo;point-and-shoot&rsquo;-style interfaces tend to have easy initial
   learning curves, but also to lack depth; they often frustrate advanced
   users who would be better served by a command-style interface.  When this
   happens, the frustrated user has a WYSIAYG problem.  This term is most
   often used of editors, word processors, and document formatting programs.
   WYSIWYG &lsquo;desktop publishing&rsquo; programs, for example, are a clear
   win for creating small documents with lots of fonts and graphics in them,
   especially things like newsletters and presentation slides.  When
   typesetting book-length manuscripts, on the other hand, scale changes the
   nature of the task; one quickly runs into WYSIAYG limitations, and the
   increased power and flexibility of a command-driven formatter like
   <glossterm>TeX</glossterm> or Unix's <glossterm>troff</glossterm> becomes
   not just desirable but a necessity.  Compare

   do not result in immediate visual feedback.  True WYSIWYG in environments

   WYSIAWYG (What You See Is <emphasis>Almost</emphasis> What You Get) and

   mildly derogatory, as they are often used to refer to dumbed-down

   <para> [from the ADVENT game] The <glossterm>canonical</glossterm>
   &lsquo;magic word&rsquo;.  This comes from <glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm>,
   in which the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to
   collect the treasures you find there.  If you type <emphasis
   role='firstterm'>xyzzy</emphasis> at the appropriate time, you can move
   instantly between two otherwise distant points.  If, therefore, you
   encounter some bit of <glossterm>magic</glossterm>, you might remark on
   this quite succinctly by saying simply <quote>Xyzzy!</quote>
   <quote>Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has
   protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you
   do it anyway.</quote> <quote>Xyzzy!</quote> It's traditional for xyzzy to
   be an <glossterm>Easter egg</glossterm> in games with text
   interfaces.</para>

   <para>Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command
   on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
   respond <quote>Nothing happens</quote>, just as
   <glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm> did if the magic was invoked at the wrong
   spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word.  In
   more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds <quote>Twice as
   much happens</quote>.</para>

   <para>Early versions of the popular &lsquo;minesweeper&rsquo; game under
   Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by the command
   &lsquo;xyzzy&lt;enter&gt;&lt;right-shift&gt;&rsquo; that turns the top-left
   pixel of the screen different colors depending on whether or not the cursor
   is over a bomb.  This feature temporarily disappeared in Windows 98, but
   reappeared in Windows 2000.</para>

   <para>The following passage from <citetitle>The Wonderful Wizard of
   Oz</citetitle> by L. Frank Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin,
   has recently come to light: <quote>Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!</quote> said
   Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.  This ended the saying of the
   charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band
   of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</para>

   in modern Pinyin transliteration yuxiang) sauce.  Usage: primarily by
   people on the MIT LISP Machine, which could display this character on the
   screen.  Tends to elicit incredulity from people who hear about it
   second-hand.</para>

   <para>Yu Shiang Whole Fish is alive and well in Unicode as U+0263 LATIN
   SMALL LETTER GAMMA (as opposed to the actual Greek letter at U+03B3, which
   usually has a loopless glyph; the form of U+0263 is consistently
   loopy). This symbol is included in Unicode as a Latin letter because it is
   used in the International Phonetic Alphabet.  In the IPA, gamma represents
   a voiced velar fricative, the sound commonly transcribed <quote>gh</quote>
   in Arabic or Klingon.</para>

   if one decides to go further and allow N (for N &gt; 1), then why not N+1?

   <para> First.  Among software designers, comes from C's and LISP's 0-based
   indexing of arrays.  Hardware people also tend to start counting at 0
   instead of 1; this is natural since, e.g., the 256 states of 8 bits
   correspond to the binary numbers 0, 1, &ellipsis;, 255 and the digital
   devices known as <emphasis role='firstterm'>counters</emphasis> count in
   this way.</para>

   <para>Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter
   of a publication &lsquo;Chapter 0&rsquo;, especially if it is of an
   introductory nature (one of the classic instances was in the First Edition
   of <glossterm linkend='K-ampersand-R'>K&amp;R</glossterm>).  In recent
   years this trait has also been observed among many pure mathematicians (who
   have an independent tradition of numbering from 0).  Zero-based numbering
   tends to reduce <glossterm>fencepost error</glossterm>s, though it cannot

<appendix id="appendixa"><title>Hacker Folklore</title>

<para>This appendix contains several legends and fables that illuminate the
meaning of various entries in the lexicon.</para>

<sect1 id='meaning-of-hack'><title>The Meaning of &lsquo;Hack&rsquo;</title>

<para><quote>The word <glossterm>hack</glossterm> doesn't really have 69
different meanings</quote>, according to MIT hacker Phil Agre.  <quote>In
fact, <glossterm>hack</glossterm> has only one meaning, an extremely subtle
and profound one which defies articulation.  Which connotation is implied by a
given use of the word depends in similarly profound ways on the context.
Similar remarks apply to a couple of other hacker words, most notably
<glossterm>random</glossterm>.</quote></para>

<para>Hacking might be characterized as &lsquo;an appropriate application of
ingenuity&rsquo;.  Whether the result is a quick-and-dirty patchwork job or a
carefully crafted work of art, you have to admire the cleverness that went
into it.</para>

<para>An important secondary meaning of <glossterm>hack</glossterm> is
&lsquo;a creative practical joke&rsquo;.  This kind of hack is easier to
explain to non-hackers than the programming kind.  Of course, some hacks have
both natures; see the lexicon entries for <glossterm>pseudo</glossterm> and
<glossterm>kgbvax</glossterm>.  But here are some examples of pure practical
jokes that illustrate the hacking spirit:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>In 1961, students from Caltech (California Institute of Technology, in
Pasadena) hacked the Rose Bowl football game.  One student posed as a reporter
and &lsquo;interviewed&rsquo; the director of the University of Washington
card stunts (such stunts involve people in the stands who hold up colored
cards to make pictures).  The reporter learned exactly how the stunts were
operated, and also that the director would be out to dinner later.</para>

<para>While the director was eating, the students (who called themselves the
&lsquo;Fiendish Fourteen&rsquo;) picked a lock and stole a blank direction
sheet for the card stunts.  They then had a printer run off 2300 copies of the
blank.  The next day they picked the lock again and stole the master plans for
the stunts &mdash; large sheets of graph paper colored in with the stunt
pictures.  Using these as a guide, they made new instructions for three of the
stunts on the duplicated blanks.  Finally, they broke in once more, replacing
the stolen master plans and substituting the stack of diddled instruction
sheets for the original set.</para>

<para>The result was that three of the pictures were totally different.
Instead of &lsquo;WASHINGTON&rsquo;, the word &lsquo;CALTECH&rsquo; was
flashed.  Another stunt showed the word &lsquo;HUSKIES&rsquo;, the Washington
nickname, but spelled it backwards.  And what was supposed to have been a
picture of a husky instead showed a beaver.  (Both Caltech and MIT use the
beaver &mdash; nature's engineer &mdash; as a mascot.)</para>

<para>After the game, the Washington faculty athletic representative said:
<quote>Some thought it ingenious; others were indignant.</quote> The
Washington student body president remarked: <quote>No hard feelings, but at
the time it was unbelievable.  We were amazed.</quote></para>
</blockquote>

<para>This is now considered a classic hack, particularly because revising the
direction sheets constituted a form of programming.</para>

<para>Here is another classic hack:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>On November 20, 1982, MIT hacked the Harvard-Yale football game.  Just
after Harvard's second touchdown against Yale, in the first quarter, a small
black ball popped up out of the ground at the 40-yard line, and grew bigger,
and bigger, and bigger.  The letters &lsquo;MIT&rsquo; appeared all over the
ball.  As the players and officials stood around gawking, the ball grew to six
feet in diameter and then burst with a bang and a cloud of white
smoke. </para>

<para>The <citetitle>Boston Globe</citetitle> later reported: <quote>If you
want to know the truth, MIT won The Game.</quote></para>

<para>The prank had taken weeks of careful planning by members of MIT's Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity.  The device consisted of a weather balloon, a
hydraulic ram powered by Freon gas to lift it out of the ground, and a
vacuum-cleaner motor to inflate it.  They made eight separate expeditions to
Harvard Stadium between 1 and 5 AM, locating an unused 110-volt circuit in the
stadium and running buried wires from the stadium circuit to the 40-yard line,
where they buried the balloon device.  When the time came to activate the
device, two fraternity members had merely to flip a circuit breaker and push a
plug into an outlet.</para>

<para>This stunt had all the earmarks of a perfect hack: surprise, publicity,
the ingenious use of technology, safety, and harmlessness.  The use of manual
control allowed the prank to be timed so as not to disrupt the game (it was
set off between plays, so the outcome of the game would not be unduly
affected).  The perpetrators had even thoughtfully attached a note to the
balloon explaining that the device was not dangerous and contained no
explosives.</para>

<para>Harvard president Derek Bok commented: <quote>They have an awful lot of
clever people down there at MIT, and they did it again.</quote> President Paul
E. Gray of MIT said: <quote>There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that I
had anything to do with it, but I wish there were.</quote></para>
</blockquote>

<para>The hacks above are verifiable history; they can be proved to have
happened.  Many other classic-hack stories from MIT and elsewhere, though
retold as history, have the characteristics of what Jan Brunvand has called
&lsquo;urban folklore&rsquo; (see <glossterm>FOAF</glossterm>).  Perhaps the
best known of these is the legend of the infamous trolley-car hack, an alleged
incident in which engineering students are said to have welded a trolley car
to its tracks with thermite.  Numerous versions of this have been recorded
from the 1940s to the present, most set at MIT but at least one very detailed
version set at CMU.</para>

<para>Here is a story about one of the classic computer hacks:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
discovered a relatively simple way to crack system security on the Xerox CP-V
timesharing system.  Through a simple programming strategy, it was possible
for a user program to trick the system into running a portion of the program
in &lsquo;master mode&rsquo; (supervisor state), in which memory protection
does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value into its
&lsquo;privilege level&rsquo; byte (normally write-protected) and could then
proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management system,
patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting things.  In short,
the barn door was wide open.</para>

<para>Motorola quite properly reported this problem to Xerox via an official
&lsquo;level 1 SIDR&rsquo; (a bug report with an intended urgency of
&lsquo;needs to be fixed yesterday&rsquo;).  Because the text of each SIDR was
entered into a database that could be viewed by quite a number of people,
Motorola followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
&lsquo;Security SIDR&rsquo;, and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc.</para>

<para>The CP-V people at Xerox sat on their thumbs; they either didn't realize
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.</para>

<para>Months passed.  The Motorola guys pestered their Xerox field-support
rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take direct action, to demonstrate
to Xerox management just how easily the system could be cracked and just how
thoroughly the security safeguards could be subverted.</para>

<para>They dug around in the operating-system listings and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then incorporated into
a pair of programs called &lsquo;Robin Hood&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friar
Tuck&rsquo;.  Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as &lsquo;ghost
jobs&rsquo; (daemons, in Unix terminology); they would use the existing
loophole to subvert system security, install the necessary patches, and then
keep an eye on one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in
effect, the superuser) from aborting them.</para>

<para>One fine day, the system operator on the main CP-V software development
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena.  These
included the following:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
job.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Disk drives would seek back and forth so rapidly that they would attempt
to walk across the floor (see <glossterm>walking drives</glossterm>).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself and
punch a &lsquo;lace card&rsquo; (card with all positions punched).  These
would usually jam in the punch.</para>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.</para> 
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The Xerox card reader had two output stackers; it could be instructed
to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A (unless a card was
unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into stacker B).  One
of the patches installed by the ghosts added some code to the
card-reader driver&ellipsis; after reading a card, it would flip over to
the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide themselves
in half when they were read, leaving the operator to recollate them
manually.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and killed them&ellipsis; and were once
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was gunned, the following sequence of events
took place:</para>

<screen>
!X id1

id1: Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!
id1: Off (aborted)

id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff
     of Nottingham's men!

id1: Thank you, my good fellow!
</screen>

<para>Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and
would start a new copy of the recently slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.</para>

<para>Finally, the system programmers did the latter &mdash; only to find that
the bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out that
these two programs had patched the boot-time OS image (the kernel file, in
Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs that were to be
started at boot time (this is similar to the way Windows viruses
propagate).</para>

<para>The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled the
monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this problem.</para>

<para>It is alleged that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management
about the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  It is not
recorded that any serious disciplinary action was taken against either of
them.</para>
</blockquote>

<para>Finally, here is a wonderful hack story for the new millennium:</para>

<para>1990's addition to the hallowed tradition of April Fool RFCs was RFC
1149, <citetitle>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian
Carriers</citetitle>.  This sketched a method for transmitting IP packets via
carrier pigeons.</para>

<para>Eleven years later, on 28 April 2001, the Bergen Linux User's Group
successfully demonstrated CPIP (Carrier Pigeon IP) between two Linux machines
running on opposite sides of a small mountain in Bergen, Norway.  Their
network stack used printers to hex-dump packets onto paper, pigeons to
transport the paper, and OCR software to read the dumps at the other end and
feed them to the receiving machine's network layer.</para>

<para>Here is the actual log of the ping command they successfully executed.
Note the exceptional packet times.</para>

<para>A web page documenting the event, with pictures, is at <ulink
url="http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/">http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/</ulink>. In
the finest Internet tradition, all software involved was open-source; the
custom parts are available for download from the site.</para>

<para>While all acknowledged the magnitude of this achievement, some debate
ensued over whether BLUG's implementation was properly conformant to the RFC.
It seems they had not used the duct tape specified in 1149 to attach messages
to pigeon legs, but instead employed other methods less objectionable to the
pigeons.  The debate was properly resolved when it was pointed out that the
duct-tape specification was not prefixed by a MUST, and was thus a
recommendation rather than a requirement.</para>

we can do interoperability tests, and maybe we finally can get the RFC into

<sect1 id="tv-typewriters"><title>TV Typewriters: A Tale of Hackish Ingenuity</title>

<para>Here is a true story about a glass tty: One day an MIT hacker was in a
motorcycle accident and broke his leg.  He had to stay in the hospital quite a
while, and got restless because he couldn't <glossterm>hack</glossterm>.  Two
of his friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the hospital,
so that he could use the computer by telephone from his hospital bed.  </para>

<para>Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers, and
computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person.  When the
two friends got to the hospital, a guard stopped them and asked what they were
carrying.  They explained that they wanted to take a computer terminal to
their friend who was a patient.</para>

<para>The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to
have in their rooms: TV, radio, electric razor, typewriter, tape player,
&ellipsis; no computer terminals.  Computer terminals weren't on the list, so
the guard wouldn't let it in.  Rules are rules, you know.  (This guard was
clearly a <glossterm>droid</glossterm>.)</para>

<para>Fair enough, said the two friends, and they left again.  They were
frustrated, of course, because they knew that the terminal was as harmless as
a TV or anything else on the list&ellipsis; which gave them an idea. </para>

<para>The next day they returned, and the same thing happened: a guard stopped
them and asked what they were carrying.  They said: <quote>This is a TV
typewriter!</quote> The guard was skeptical, so they plugged it in and
demonstrated it.  <quote>See?  You just type on the keyboard and what you type
shows up on the TV screen.</quote> Now the guard didn't stop to think about
how utterly useless a typewriter would be that didn't produce any paper copies
of what you typed; but this was clearly a TV typewriter, no doubt about it.
So he checked his list: &ldquo;A TV is all right, a typewriter is all right
&ellipsis; okay, take it on in!&rdquo;</para>

<para>[Historical note: Many years ago, <citetitle>Popular
Electronics</citetitle> published solder-it-yourself plans for a TV
typewriter.  Despite the essential uselessness of the device, it was an
enormously popular project.  Steve Ciarcia, the man behind
<citetitle>Byte</citetitle> magazine's <quote>Circuit Cellar</quote> feature,
resurrected this ghost in one of his books of the early 1980s.  He ascribed
its popularity (no doubt correctly) to the feeling of power the builder could
achieve by being able to decide himself what would be shown on the TV. And, in
fact, the device was not entirely useless; when combined with a modem board,
it became a crude but serviceable terminal. &mdash;ESR]</para>

<para>[Antihistorical note: On September 23rd, 1992, the L.A. Times ran the
following bit in Steve Harvey's &lsquo;Only in L.A.' column:</para>

<sect1 id='magic-story'><title>A Story About &lsquo;Magic'</title>

<para>Some years ago, I (GLS) was snooping around in the cabinets that housed
the MIT AI Lab's PDP-10, and noticed a little switch glued to the frame of one
cabinet.  It was obviously a homebrew job, added by one of the lab's hardware
hackers (no one knows who).</para>

<para>You don't touch an unknown switch on a computer without knowing what it
does, because you might crash the computer.  The switch was labeled in a most
unhelpful way.  It had two positions, and scrawled in pencil on the metal
switch body were the words &lsquo;magic' and &lsquo;more magic'.  The switch
was in the &lsquo;more magic' position.</para>

<para>I called another hacker over to look at it.  He had never seen the
switch before either.  Closer examination revealed that the switch had only
one wire running to it!  The other end of the wire did disappear into the maze
of wires inside the computer, but it's a basic fact of electricity that a
switch can't do anything unless there are two wires connected to it.  This
switch had a wire connected on one side and no wire on its other side.</para>

<para>It was clear that this switch was someone's idea of a silly joke.
Convinced by our reasoning that the switch was inoperative, we flipped it.
The computer instantly crashed.</para>

<para>Imagine our utter astonishment.  We wrote it off as coincidence, but
nevertheless restored the switch to the &lsquo;more magic&rsquo; position
before reviving the computer.</para>

<para>A year later, I told this story to yet another hacker, David Moon as I
recall.  He clearly doubted my sanity, or suspected me of a supernatural
belief in the power of this switch, or perhaps thought I was fooling him with
a bogus saga.  To prove it to him, I showed him the very switch, still glued
to the cabinet frame with only one wire connected to it, still in the
&lsquo;more magic&rsquo; position.  We scrutinized the switch and its lone
connection, and found that the other end of the wire, though connected to the
computer wiring, was connected to a ground pin.  That clearly made the switch
doubly useless: not only was it electrically nonoperative, but it was
connected to a place that couldn't affect anything anyway.  So we flipped the
switch.</para>

<para>The computer promptly crashed.</para>

<para>This time we ran for Richard Greenblatt, a long-time MIT hacker, who was
close at hand.  He had never noticed the switch before, either.  He inspected
it, concluded it was useless, got some diagonal cutters and
<glossterm>dike</glossterm>d it out.  We then revived the computer and it has
run fine ever since.</para>

<para>We still don't know how the switch crashed the machine.  There is a
theory that some circuit near the ground pin was marginal, and flipping the
switch changed the electrical capacitance enough to upset the circuit as
millionth-of-a-second pulses went through it.  But we'll never know for sure;
all we can really say is that the switch was
<glossterm>magic</glossterm>.</para>

<para>I still have that switch in my basement.  Maybe I'm silly, but I usually
keep it set on &lsquo;more magic&rsquo;.</para>

<para>1994: Another explanation of this story has since been offered.  Note
that the switch body was metal.  Suppose that the non-connected side of the
switch was connected to the switch body (usually the body is connected to a
separate earth lug, but there are exceptions).  The body is connected to the
computer case, which is, presumably, grounded.  Now the circuit ground within
the machine isn't necessarily at the same potential as the case ground, so
flipping the switch connected the circuit ground to the case ground, causing a
voltage drop/jump which reset the machine.  This was probably discovered by
someone who found out the hard way that there was a potential difference
between the two, and who then wired in the switch as a joke.</para>

<sect1 id='os-and-jedgar'><title>OS and JEDGAR</title>

<para>This story says a lot about the ITS ethos.</para>

<para>On the ITS system there was a program that allowed you to see what was
being printed on someone else's terminal.  It spied on the other guy's output
by examining the insides of the monitor system.  The output spy program was
called OS. Throughout the rest of the computer science world (and at IBM too)
OS means &lsquo;operating system&rsquo;, but among old-time ITS hackers it
almost always meant &lsquo;output spy&rsquo;.</para>

<para>OS could work because ITS purposely had very little in the way of
&lsquo;protection&rsquo; that prevented one user from trespassing on another's
areas.  Fair is fair, however.  There was another program that would
automatically notify you if anyone started to spy on your output.  It worked
in exactly the same way, by looking at the insides of the operating system to
see if anyone else was looking at the insides that had to do with your output.
This &lsquo;counterspy&rsquo; program was called JEDGAR (a six-letterism
pronounced as two syllables: <emphasis
role="pronunciation">/jed&acute;gr/</emphasis>), in honor of the former head
of the FBI.</para>

<para>But there's more.  JEDGAR would ask the user for &lsquo;license to
kill&rsquo;.  If the user said yes, then JEDGAR would actually gun the job of
the <glossterm>luser</glossterm> who was spying.  Unfortunately, people found
that this made life too violent, especially when tourists learned about it.
One of the systems hackers solved the problem by replacing JEDGAR with another
program that only pretended to do its job.  It took a long time to do this,
because every copy of JEDGAR had to be patched.  To this day no one knows how
many people never figured out that JEDGAR had been defanged.</para>

<para>Interestingly, there is still a security module named JEDGAR alive as of
late 1999 &mdash; in the Unisys MCP for large systems.  It is unknown to us
whether the name is tribute or independent invention.</para>

<sect1 id="story-of-mel"><title>The Story of Mel</title>

<para>This was posted to Usenet by its author, Ed Nather
(<email>nather@astro.as.utexas.edu</email>), on May 21, 1983.</para>

<literallayout>
A recent article devoted to the <emphasis>macho</emphasis> side of programming
made the bald and unvarnished statement:

    Real Programmers write in FORTRAN.

Maybe they do now,
in this decadent era of
Lite beer, hand calculators, and <quote>user-friendly</quote> software
but back in the Good Old Days,
when the term <quote>software</quote> sounded funny
and Real Computers were made out of drums and vacuum tubes,
Real Programmers wrote in machine code.
Not FORTRAN.  Not RATFOR.  Not, even, assembly language.
Machine Code.
Raw, unadorned, inscrutable hexadecimal numbers.
Directly.

Lest a whole new generation of programmers
grow up in ignorance of this glorious past,
I feel duty-bound to describe,
as best I can through the generation gap,
how a Real Programmer wrote code.
I'll call him Mel,
because that was his name.

I first met Mel when I went to work for Royal McBee Computer Corp.,
a now-defunct subsidiary of the typewriter company.
The firm manufactured the LGP-30,
a small, cheap (by the standards of the day)
drum-memory computer,
and had just started to manufacture
the RPC-4000, a much-improved,
bigger, better, faster &mdash; drum-memory computer.
Cores cost too much,
and weren't here to stay, anyway.
(That's why you haven't heard of the company,
or the computer.)

I had been hired to write a FORTRAN compiler
for this new marvel and Mel was my guide to its wonders.
Mel didn't approve of compilers.

<quote>If a program can't rewrite its own code</quote>,
he asked, <quote>what good is it?</quote>

Mel had written,
in hexadecimal,
the most popular computer program the company owned.
It ran on the LGP-30
and played blackjack with potential customers
at computer shows.
Its effect was always dramatic.
The LGP-30 booth was packed at every show,
and the IBM salesmen stood around
talking to each other.
Whether or not this actually sold computers
was a question we never discussed.

Mel's job was to re-write
the blackjack program for the RPC-4000.
(Port?  What does that mean?)
The new computer had a one-plus-one
addressing scheme,
in which each machine instruction,
in addition to the operation code
and the address of the needed operand,
had a second address that indicated where, on the revolving drum,
the next instruction was located.

In modern parlance,
every single instruction was followed by a GO TO!
Put <emphasis>that</emphasis> in Pascal's pipe and smoke it.

Mel loved the RPC-4000
because he could optimize his code:
that is, locate instructions on the drum
so that just as one finished its job,
the next would be just arriving at the <quote>read head</quote>
and available for immediate execution.
There was a program to do that job,
an <quote>optimizing assembler</quote>,
but Mel refused to use it.

<quote>You never know where it's going to put things</quote>,
he explained, <quote>so you'd have to use separate constants</quote>.

It was a long time before I understood that remark.
Since Mel knew the numerical value
of every operation code,
and assigned his own drum addresses,
every instruction he wrote could also be considered
a numerical constant.
He could pick up an earlier <quote>add</quote> instruction, say,
and multiply by it,
if it had the right numeric value.
His code was not easy for someone else to modify.

I compared Mel's hand-optimized programs
with the same code massaged by the optimizing assembler program,
and Mel's always ran faster.
That was because the <quote>top-down</quote> method of program design
hadn't been invented yet,
and Mel wouldn't have used it anyway.
He wrote the innermost parts of his program loops first,
so they would get first choice
of the optimum address locations on the drum.
The optimizing assembler wasn't smart enough to do it that way.

Mel never wrote time-delay loops, either,
even when the balky Flexowriter
required a delay between output characters to work right.
He just located instructions on the drum
so each successive one was just <emphasis>past</emphasis> the read head
when it was needed;
the drum had to execute another complete revolution
to find the next instruction.
He coined an unforgettable term for this procedure.
Although <quote>optimum</quote> is an absolute term,
like <quote>unique</quote>, it became common verbal practice
to make it relative:
<quote>not quite optimum</quote> or <quote>less optimum</quote>
or <quote>not very optimum</quote>.
Mel called the maximum time-delay locations
the <quote>most pessimum</quote>.

After he finished the blackjack program
and got it to run
(<quote>Even the initializer is optimized</quote>,
he said proudly),
he got a Change Request from the sales department.
The program used an elegant (optimized)
random number generator
to shuffle the <quote>cards</quote> and deal from the <quote>deck</quote>,
and some of the salesmen felt it was too fair,
since sometimes the customers lost.
They wanted Mel to modify the program
so, at the setting of a sense switch on the console,
they could change the odds and let the customer win.

Mel balked.
He felt this was patently dishonest,
which it was,
and that it impinged on his personal integrity as a programmer,
which it did,
so he refused to do it.
The Head Salesman talked to Mel,
as did the Big Boss and, at the boss's urging,
a few Fellow Programmers.
Mel finally gave in and wrote the code,
but he got the test backwards,
and, when the sense switch was turned on,
the program would cheat, winning every time.
Mel was delighted with this,
claiming his subconscious was uncontrollably ethical,
and adamantly refused to fix it.

After Mel had left the company for greener pa$ture$,
the Big Boss asked me to look at the code
and see if I could find the test and reverse it.
Somewhat reluctantly, I agreed to look.
Tracking Mel's code was a real adventure.

I have often felt that programming is an art form,
whose real value can only be appreciated
by another versed in the same arcane art;
there are lovely gems and brilliant coups
hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever,
by the very nature of the process.
You can learn a lot about an individual
just by reading through his code,
even in hexadecimal.
Mel was, I think, an unsung genius.

Perhaps my greatest shock came
when I found an innocent loop that had no test in it.
No test.  <emphasis>None</emphasis>.
Common sense said it had to be a closed loop,
where the program would circle, forever, endlessly.
Program control passed right through it, however,
and safely out the other side.
It took me two weeks to figure it out.

The RPC-4000 computer had a really modern facility
called an index register.
It allowed the programmer to write a program loop
that used an indexed instruction inside;
each time through,
the number in the index register
was added to the address of that instruction,
so it would refer
to the next datum in a series.
He had only to increment the index register
each time through.
Mel never used it.

Instead, he would pull the instruction into a machine register,
add one to its address,
and store it back.
He would then execute the modified instruction
right from the register.
The loop was written so this additional execution time
was taken into account &mdash;
just as this instruction finished,
the next one was right under the drum's read head,
ready to go.
But the loop had no test in it.

The vital clue came when I noticed
the index register bit,
the bit that lay between the address
and the operation code in the instruction word,
was turned on &mdash;
yet Mel never used the index register,
leaving it zero all the time.
When the light went on it nearly blinded me.

He had located the data he was working on
near the top of memory &mdash;
the largest locations the instructions could address &mdash;
so, after the last datum was handled,
incrementing the instruction address
would make it overflow.
The carry would add one to the
operation code, changing it to the next one in the instruction set:
a jump instruction.
Sure enough, the next program instruction was
in address location zero,
and the program went happily on its way.

I haven't kept in touch with Mel,
so I don't know if he ever gave in to the flood of
change that has washed over programming techniques
since those long-gone days.
I like to think he didn't.
In any event,
I was impressed enough that I quit looking for the
offending test,
telling the Big Boss I couldn't find it.
He didn't seem surprised.

When I left the company,
the blackjack program would still cheat
if you turned on the right sense switch,
and I think that's how it should be.
I didn't feel comfortable
hacking up the code of a Real Programmer.

<appendix id="appendixb"><title>A Portrait of J. Random Hacker</title>

<para>This profile reflects detailed comments on an earlier &lsquo;trial
balloon&rsquo; version from about a hundred Usenet respondents.  Where
comparatives are used, the implicit &lsquo;other&rsquo; is a randomly selected
segment of the non-hacker population of the same size as hackerdom.</para>

<para>An important point: Except in some relatively minor respects such as
slang vocabulary, hackers don't get to be the way they are by imitating each
other.  Rather, it seems to be the case that the combination of personality
traits that makes a hacker so conditions one's outlook on life that one tends
to end up being like other hackers whether one wants to or not (much as
bizarrely detailed similarities in behavior and preferences are found in
genetic twins raised separately).</para>

<sect1 id='appearance'><title>General Appearance</title>

<para>Intelligent.  Scruffy.  Intense.  Abstracted.  Surprisingly for a
sedentary profession, more hackers run to skinny than fat; both extremes are
more common than elsewhere.  Tans are rare.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='dress'><title>Dress</title>

<para>Casual, vaguely post-hippie; T-shirts, jeans, running shoes,
Birk-enstocks (or bare feet).  Long hair, beards, and moustaches are common.
High incidence of tie-dye and intellectual or humorous &lsquo;slogan&rsquo;
T-shirts.  Until the mid-1990s such T-shirts were seldom computer-related, as
that would have been too obvious &mdash; but the hacker culture has since developed
its own icons, and J. Random Hacker now often wears a Linux penguin or BSD
daemon or a DeCSS protest shirt.</para>

<para>A substantial minority prefers &lsquo;outdoorsy&rsquo; clothing &mdash;
hiking boots (<quote>in case a mountain should suddenly spring up in the
machine room</quote>, as one famous parody put it), khakis, lumberjack or
chamois shirts, and the like.</para>

<para>After about 1995 hacker dress styles assimilated some influence from
punk, gothic, and rave subcultures.  This was relatively mild and has
manifested mostly as a tendency to wear a lot of black, especially when
&lsquo;dressed up&rsquo; to the limit of formality.  Other markers of those
subcultures such as piercings, chains, and dyed hair remain relatively
uncommon. Hackers appear to wear black more because it goes with everything
and hides dirt than because they want to look like goths.</para>

<para>Very few hackers actually fit the <citetitle>National
Lampoon</citetitle> Nerd stereotype, though it lingers on at MIT and may have
been more common before 1975.  At least since the late Seventies backpacks
have been more common than briefcases, and the hacker &lsquo;look&rsquo; has
been more whole-earth than whole-polyester.</para>

<para>Hackers dress for comfort, function, and minimal maintenance hassles
rather than for appearance (some, perhaps unfortunately, take this to extremes
and neglect personal hygiene).  They have a very low tolerance of suits and
other &lsquo;business&rsquo; attire; in fact, it is not uncommon for hackers
to quit a job rather than conform to a dress code.  When they are somehow
backed into conforming to a dress code, they will find ways to subvert it, for
example by wearing absurd novelty ties.</para>

<para>Female hackers almost never wear visible makeup, and many use none at
all.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='reading_habits'><title>Reading Habits</title>

<para>Omnivorous, but usually includes lots of science and science fiction.
The typical hacker household might subscribe to <citetitle>Analog</citetitle>,
<citetitle>Scientific American</citetitle>, <citetitle>Whole-Earth
Review</citetitle>, and <citetitle>Smithsonian</citetitle> (most hackers
ignore <citetitle>Wired</citetitle> and other self-consciously
&lsquo;cyberpunk&rsquo; magazines, considering them
<glossterm>wannabee</glossterm> fodder).  Hackers often have a reading range
that astonishes liberal arts people but tend not to talk about it as much.
Many hackers spend as much of their spare time reading as the average American
burns up watching TV, and often keep shelves and shelves of well-thumbed books
in their homes.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='other-interests'><title>Other Interests</title>

<para>Some hobbies are widely shared and recognized as going with the culture:
science fiction, music, medievalism (in the active form practiced by the
Society for Creative Anachronism and similar organizations), chess, go,
backgammon, wargames, and intellectual games of all kinds.  (Role-playing
games such as Dungeons and Dragons used to be extremely popular among hackers
but they lost a bit of their luster as they moved into the mainstream and
became heavily commercialized.  More recently, <citetitle>Magic: The
Gathering</citetitle> has been widely popular among hackers.)  Logic puzzles.
Ham radio.  Other interests that seem to correlate less strongly but
positively with hackerdom include linguistics and theater teching.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='physical'><title>Physical Activity and Sports</title>

<para>Many (perhaps even most) hackers don't follow or do sports at all and
are determinedly anti-physical.  Among those who do, interest in spectator
sports is low to non-existent; sports are something one
<emphasis>does</emphasis>, not something one watches on TV.</para>

<para>Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague.  Volleyball was
long a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and relatively
friendly; Ultimate Frisbee has become quite popular for similar reasons.
Hacker sports are almost always primarily self-competitive ones involving
concentration, stamina, and micromotor skills: martial arts, bicycling, auto
racing, kite flying, hiking, rock climbing, aviation, target-shooting,
sailing, caving, juggling, skiing, skating, skydiving, scuba diving.  Hackers'
delight in techno-toys also tends to draw them towards hobbies with nifty
complicated equipment that they can tinker with.</para>

<para>The popularity of martial arts in the hacker culture deserves special
mention.  Many observers have noted it, and the connection has grown
noticeably stronger over time.  In the 1970s, many hackers admired martial
arts disciplines from a distance, sensing a compatible ideal in their
exaltation of skill through rigorous self-discipline and concentration.  As
martial arts became increasingly mainstreamed in the U.S. and other western
countries, hackers moved from admiring to doing in large numbers.  In 1997,
for example, your humble editor recalls sitting down with five strangers at
the first Perl conference and discovering that four of us were in active
training in some sort of martial art &mdash; and, what is more interesting,
nobody at the table found this high perecentage at all odd.</para>

<para>Today (2000), martial arts seems to have become firmly established as
the hacker exercise form of choice, and the martial-arts culture combining
skill-centered elitism with a willingness to let anybody join seems a stronger
parallel to hacker behavior than ever.  Common usages in hacker slang
un-ironically analogize programming to kung fu (thus, one hears talk of
<quote>code-fu</quote> or in reference to specific skills like
<quote>HTML-fu</quote>).  Albeit with slightly more irony, today's hackers
readily analogize assimilation into the hacker culture with the plot of a Jet
Li movie: the aspiring newbie studies with masters of the tradition, develops
his art through deep meditation, ventures forth to perform heroic feats of
hacking, and eventually becomes a master who trains the next generation of
newbies in the hacker way.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='education'><title>Education</title>

<para>Nearly all hackers past their teens are either college-degreed or
self-educated to an equivalent level.  The self-taught hacker is often
considered (at least by other hackers) to be better-motivated, and may be more
respected, than his school-shaped counterpart.  Academic areas from which
people often gravitate into hackerdom include (besides the obvious computer
science and electrical engineering) physics, mathematics, linguistics, and
philosophy.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='hates'><title>Things Hackers Detest and Avoid</title>

<para>All the works of Microsoft.  Smurfs, Ewoks, and other forms of offensive
cuteness.  Bureaucracies.  Stupid people.  Easy listening music.  Television
(with occasional exceptions for cartoons, movies, and good SF like
<citetitle>Star Trek</citetitle> classic or Babylon 5).  Business suits.
Dishonesty.  Incompetence.  Boredom.  COBOL. BASIC.  Character-based menu
interfaces.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="food"><title>Food</title>

<para>Ethnic.  Spicy.  Oriental, esp. Chinese and most esp. Szechuan, Hunan,
and Mandarin (hackers consider Cantonese vaguely
<foreignphrase>d&eacute;class&eacute;</foreignphrase>).  Hackers prefer the
exotic; for example, the Japanese-food fans among them will eat with gusto
such delicacies as fugu (poisonous pufferfish) and whale.  Thai food has
experienced flurries of popularity.  Where available, high-quality Jewish
delicatessen food is much esteemed.  A visible minority of Southwestern and
Pacific Coast hackers prefers Mexican.</para>

<para>For those all-night hacks, pizza and microwaved burritos are big.
Interestingly, though the mainstream culture has tended to think of hackers as
incorrigible junk-food junkies, many have at least mildly health-foodist
attitudes and are fairly discriminating about what they eat.  This may be
generational; anecdotal evidence suggests that the stereotype was more on the
mark before the early 1980s.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='politics'><title>Politics</title>

<para>Formerly vaguely liberal-moderate, more recently
moderate-to-neoconservative (hackers too were affected by the collapse of
socialism). There is a strong libertarian contingent which rejects
conventional left-right politics entirely.  The only safe generalization is
that hackers tend to be rather anti-authoritarian; thus, both
paleoconservatism and &lsquo;hard&rsquo; leftism are rare.  Hackers are far
more likely than most non-hackers to either (a) be aggressively apolitical or
(b) entertain peculiar or idiosyncratic political ideas and actually try to
live by them day-to-day.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='demographics'><title>Gender and Ethnicity</title>

<para>Hackerdom is still predominantly male.  However, the percentage of women
is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical
professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with as
equals.</para>

<para>In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities
of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast).  The Jewish contingent has
exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see <link
linkend="food">Food</link>, above, and note that several common jargon terms
are obviously mutated Yiddish).</para>

<para>The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a
function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education.  Racial and
ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing
contempt.</para>

<para>When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this
is doubtless a powerful influence.  Also, the ties many hackers have to AI
research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of
personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive &mdash; after all, if one's
imagination readily grants full human rights to future AI programs, robots,
dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very
important any more.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="religion"><title>Religion</title>

<para>Agnostic.  Atheist.  Non-observant Jewish.  Neo-pagan.  Very commonly,
three or more of these are combined in the same person.  Conventional
faith-holding Christianity is rare though not unknown.</para>

<para>Even hackers who identify with a religious affiliation tend to be
relaxed about it, hostile to organized religion in general and all forms of
religious bigotry in particular.  Many enjoy &lsquo;parody&rsquo; religions
such as Discordianism and the Church of the SubGenius.</para>

<para>Also, many hackers are influenced to varying degrees by Zen Buddhism or
(less commonly) Taoism, and blend them easily with their &lsquo;native&rsquo;
religions.</para>

<para>There is a definite strain of mystical, almost Gnostic sensibility that
shows up even among those hackers not actively involved with neo-paganism,
Discordianism, or Zen.  Hacker folklore that pays homage to
&lsquo;wizards&rsquo; and speaks of incantations and demons has too much
psychological truthfulness about it to be entirely a joke.  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='chemicals'><title>Ceremonial Chemicals</title>

<para>Most hackers don't smoke tobacco, and use alcohol in moderation if at
all.  However, there has been something of a trend towards exotic beers since
about 1995, especially among younger Linux hackers apparently influenced by
Linus Torvalds's fondness for Guinness.</para>

<para>Limited use of non-addictive psychedelic drugs, such as cannabis, LSD,
psilocybin, nitrous oxide, etc., used to be relatively common and is still
regarded with more tolerance than in the mainstream culture.  Use of
&lsquo;downers&rsquo; and opiates, on the other hand, appears to be
particularly rare; hackers seem in general to dislike drugs that make them
stupid. But <glossterm>on the gripping hand</glossterm>, many hackers
regularly wire up on caffeine and/or sugar for all-night hacking runs.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='communication_style'><title>Communication Style</title>

<para>See the discussions of speech and writing styles near the beginning of
this File.  Though hackers often have poor person-to-person communication
skills, they are as a rule quite sensitive to nuances of language and very
precise in their use of it.  They are often better at writing than at
speaking.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='geography'><title>Geographical Distribution</title>

<para>In the United States, hackerdom revolves on a Bay Area-to-Boston axis;
about half of the hard core seems to live within a hundred miles of Cambridge
(Massachusetts) or Berkeley (California), although there are significant
contingents in Los Angeles, in the Pacific Northwest, and around Washington
DC.  Hackers tend to cluster around large cities, especially &lsquo;university
towns&rsquo; such as the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina or Princeton,
New Jersey (this may simply reflect the fact that many are students or
ex-students living near their alma maters).  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='sex'><title>Sexual Habits</title>

<para>Hackerdom easily tolerates a much wider range of sexual and lifestyle
variation than the mainstream culture.  It includes a relatively large gay and
bisexual contingent.  Hackers are somewhat more likely to live in polygynous
or polyandrous relationships, practice open marriage, or live in communes or
group houses.  In this, as in general appearance, hackerdom semi-consciously
maintains &lsquo;counterculture&rsquo; values.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='personality'><title>Personality Characteristics</title>

<para>The most obvious common &lsquo;personality&rsquo; characteristics of
hackers are high intelligence, consuming curiosity, and facility with
intellectual abstractions.  Also, most hackers are &lsquo;neophiles&rsquo;,
stimulated by and appreciative of novelty (especially intellectual novelty).
Most are also relatively individualistic and anti-conformist.</para>

<para>Although high general intelligence is common among hackers, it is not
the <foreignphrase>sine qua non</foreignphrase> one might expect.  Another
trait is probably even more important: the ability to mentally absorb, retain,
and reference large amounts of &lsquo;meaningless&rsquo; detail, trusting to
later experience to give it context and meaning.  A person of merely average
analytical intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but
a creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by
people who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their
brains.  [During the production of the first book version of this document,
for example, I learned most of the rather complex typesetting language TeX
over about four working days, mainly by inhaling Knuth's 477-page manual.  My
editor's flabbergasted reaction to this genuinely surprised me, because years
of associating with hackers have conditioned me to consider such performances
routine and to be expected. &mdash;ESR]</para>

<para>Contrary to stereotype, hackers are <emphasis>not</emphasis> usually
intellectually narrow; they tend to be interested in any subject that can
provide mental stimulation, and can often discourse knowledgeably and even
interestingly on any number of obscure subjects &mdash; if you can get them to
talk at all, as opposed to, say, going back to their hacking.</para>

<para>It is noticeable (and contrary to many outsiders' expectations) that the
better a hacker is at hacking, the more likely he or she is to have outside
interests at which he or she is more than merely competent.  </para>

<para>Hackers are &lsquo;control freaks&rsquo; in a way that has nothing to do
with the usual coercive or authoritarian connotations of the term.  In the
same way that children delight in making model trains go forward and back by
moving a switch, hackers love making complicated things like computers do
nifty stuff for them.  But it has to be <emphasis>their</emphasis> nifty
stuff.  They don't like tedium, nondeterminism, or most of the fussy, boring,
ill-defined little tasks that go with maintaining a normal existence.
Accordingly, they tend to be careful and orderly in their intellectual lives
and chaotic elsewhere.  Their code will be beautiful, even if their desks are
buried in 3 feet of crap.  </para>

<para>Hackers are generally only very weakly motivated by conventional rewards
such as social approval or money.  They tend to be attracted by challenges and
excited by interesting toys, and to judge the interest of work or other
activities in terms of the challenges offered and the toys they get to play
with.  </para>

<para>In terms of Myers-Briggs and equivalent psychometric systems, hackerdom
appears to concentrate the relatively rare INTJ and INTP types; that is,
introverted, intuitive, and thinker types (as opposed to the
extroverted-sensate personalities that predominate in the mainstream culture).
ENT[JP] types are also concentrated among hackers but are in a minority.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id='weaknesses'><title>Weaknesses of the Hacker Personality</title>

<para>Hackers have relatively little ability to identify emotionally with
other people.  This may be because hackers generally aren't much like
&lsquo;other people&rsquo;.  Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend towards
self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people and tasks
perceived to be wasting their time.</para>

<para>As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the
world, they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational,
&lsquo;cool&rsquo;, and imaginative as they consider themselves.  This bias
often contributes to weakness in communication skills.  Hackers tend to be
especially poor at confrontation and negotiation.  </para>

<para>Another weakness of the hacker personality is a perverse tendancy to
attack all problems from the most technically complicated angle, just because
it may mean more interesting problems to solve, or cooler toys to play with.
Hackers sometimes have trouble grokking that the bubble gum and paperclip
hardware fix is actually the way to go, and that they really don't need to
convince the client to buy that shiny new tool they've had your eye on for two
months.</para>

<para>Because of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the
<glossterm>Right Thing</glossterm>, hackers can be unfortunately intolerant
and bigoted on technical issues, in marked contrast to their general spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise.  Old-time
<glossterm>ITS</glossterm> partisans look down on the ever-growing hordes of
<glossterm>Unix</glossterm> and <glossterm>Linux</glossterm> hackers; Unix
aficionados despise <glossterm>VMS</glossterm> and Windows; and hackers who
are used to conventional command-line user interfaces loudly loathe
mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh.  Hackers who don't indulge
in <glossterm>Usenet</glossterm> consider it a huge waste of time and
<glossterm>bandwidth</glossterm>; fans of old adventure games such as
<glossterm>ADVENT</glossterm> and <glossterm>Zork</glossterm> consider
<glossterm>MUD</glossterm>s to be glorified chat systems devoid of atmosphere
or interesting puzzles; hackers who are willing to devote endless hours to
Usenet or MUDs consider <glossterm>IRC</glossterm> to be a
<emphasis>real</emphasis> waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay if
there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way.  And, of course, there are
the perennial <glossterm>holy wars</glossterm> &mdash;
<glossterm>EMACS</glossterm> vs. <glossterm>vi</glossterm>,
<glossterm>big-endian</glossterm> vs.  <glossterm>little-endian</glossterm>,
RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc., etc.  As in society at large, the intensity and
duration of these debates is usually inversely proportional to the number of
objective, factual arguments available to buttress any position.</para>

<para>As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships.  At worst, they can produce the classic
<glossterm>geek</glossterm>: withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually
frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft.
Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than mainstream folklore paints
it &mdash; but almost all hackers will recognize something of themselves in
the unflattering paragraphs above.</para>

<para>Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing
with the physical world.  Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles up to
incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance tasks get
deferred indefinitely.</para>

<para>1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a syndrome called Attention Deficit
Disorder (ADD), supposedly characterized by (among other things) a combination
of short attention span with an ability to &lsquo;hyperfocus&rsquo;
imaginatively on interesting tasks.  In 1998-1999 another syndrome that is
said to overlap with many hacker traits entered popular awareness: Asperger's
syndrome (AS).  This disorder is also sometimes called &lsquo;high-function
autism&rsquo;, though researchers are divided on whether AS is in fact a mild
form of autism or a distinct syndrome with a different etiology.  AS patients
exhibit mild to severe deficits in interpreting facial and body-language cues
and in modeling or empathizing with others' emotions.  Though some AS patients
exhibit mild retardation, others compensate for their deficits with high
intelligence and analytical ability, and frequently seek out technical fields
where problem-solving abilities are at a premium and people skills are
relatively unimportant.  Both syndromes are thought to relate to abnormalities
in neurotransmitter chemistry, especially the brain's processing of
serotonin.</para>

<para>Many hackers have noticed that mainstream culture has shown a tendency
to pathologize and medicalize normal variations in personality, especially
those variations that make life more complicated for authority figures and
conformists. Thus, hackers aware of the issue tend to be among those
questioning whether ADD and AS actually exist; and if so whether they are
really &lsquo;diseases&rsquo; rather than extremes of a normal genetic
variation like having freckles or being able to taste DPT.  In either case,
they have a sneaking tendency to wonder if these syndromes are over-diagnosed
and over-treated.  After all, people in authority will always be
inconvenienced by schoolchildren or workers or citizens who are prickly,
intelligent individualists &mdash; thus, any social system that depends on
authority relationships will tend to helpfully ostracize and therapize and
drug such &lsquo;abnormal&rsquo; people until they are properly docile and
stupid and &lsquo;well-socialized&rsquo;.</para>

<para>So hackers tend to believe they have good reason for skepticism about
clinical explanations of the hacker personality.  That being said, most would
also concede that some hacker traits coincide with indicators for
non-hyperactive ADD and AS &mdash; the status of caffeine as a hacker beverage of
choice may be connected to the fact that it bonds to the same neural receptors
as Ritalin, the drug most commonly prescribed for ADD.  It is probably true
that boosters of both would find a rather higher rate of clinical ADD among
hackers than the supposedly mainstream-normal 3-5% (AS is rarer at
0.4-0.5%).</para>

<para>Hackers are more likely to have cats than dogs (in fact, it is widely
grokked that cats have the hacker nature).  Many drive incredibly decrepit
heaps and forget to wash them; richer ones drive spiffy Porsches and RX-7s and
then forget to have them washed.  Almost all hackers have terribly bad
handwriting, and often fall into the habit of block-printing everything like
junior draftsmen.</para>

<appendix id='appendixc'><title>Helping Hacker Culture Grow</title>

<para>If you have enjoyed the Jargon File, please help the culture that
created it grow and flourish.  Here are several ways you can help:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write
<glossterm>hacker</glossterm> when you mean <glossterm>cracker</glossterm>.
If you work with writers or journalists, educate them on this issue and push
them to do the right thing. If you catch a newspaper or magazine abusing the
word &lsquo;hacker&rsquo;, write them and straighten them out (this appendix
includes a model letter).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you're a techie or computer hobbyist, get involved with one
of the free Unixes.  Toss out that lame Microsoft OS, or confine it to one
disk partition and put Linux or FreeBSD or NetBSD on the other one.  And the
next time your friend or boss is thinking about some proprietary software
&lsquo;solution&rsquo; that costs more than it's worth, be ready to blow the
competition away with open-source software running over a
Unix.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Contribute to organizations like the Free Software Foundation
that promote the production of high-quality free and open-source software.
You can reach the Free Software Foundation at <email>gnu@gnu.org</email>, by
phone at +1-617-542-5942, or by snail-mail at 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Support the League for Programming Freedom, which opposes
over-broad software patents that constantly threaten to blow up in hackers'
faces, preventing them from developing innovative software for tomorrow's
needs.  You can reach the League for Programming Freedom at
<email>lpf@uunet.uu.net</email>. by phone at +1 617 621 7084, or by

<listitem><para>If you do nothing else, please help fight government attempts

</itemizedlist>

<para>Here's the text of a letter RMS wrote to the Wall Street Journal to
complain about their policy of using <quote>hacker</quote> only in a
pejorative sense.  We hear that most major newspapers have the same policy.
If you'd like to help change this situation, send your favorite newspaper the
same letter &mdash; or, better yet, write your own letter.</para>

<blockquote>
<para>This letter is not meant for publication, although you can publish it if
you wish.  It is meant specifically for you, the editor, not the
public. </para>

<para>I am a hacker.  That is to say, I enjoy playing with computers &mdash;
working with, learning about, and writing clever computer programs.  I am not
a cracker; I don't make a practice of breaking computer security. </para>

<para>There's nothing shameful about the hacking I do.  But when I tell people
I am a hacker, people think I'm admitting something naughty &mdash; because
newspapers such as yours misuse the word <quote>hacker</quote>, giving the
impression that it means <quote>security breaker</quote> and nothing else.
You are giving hackers a bad name. </para>

<para>The saddest thing is that this problem is perpetuated deliberately.
Your reporters know the difference between <quote>hacker</quote> and
<quote>security breaker</quote>.  They know how to make the distinction, but
you don't let them!  You insist on using <quote>hacker</quote> pejoratively.
When reporters try to use another word, you change it.  When reporters try to
explain the other meanings, you cut it.</para>

<para>Of course, you have a reason.  You say that readers have become used to
your insulting usage of <quote>hacker</quote>, so that you cannot change it
now.  Well, you can't undo past mistakes today; but that is no excuse to
repeat them tomorrow.</para>

<para>If I were what you call a <quote>hacker</quote>, at this point I would
threaten to crack your computer and crash it.  But I am a hacker, not a
cracker.  I don't do that kind of thing!  I have enough computers to play with
at home and at work; I don't need yours.  Besides, it's not my way to respond
to insults with violence.  My response is this letter.</para>

<para>You owe hackers an apology; but more than that, you owe us ordinary
respect.</para>

<abstract><para>This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar in
format to the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from TNHD-2) but
somewhat different in tone and intent.  It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and quirky
imagination.  For example, it defines <emphasis role='firstterm'>computer
science</emphasis> as <quote>a study akin to numerology and astrology, but
lacking the precision of the former and the success of the latter</quote> and
<emphasis role='firstterm'>implementation</emphasis> as <quote>The fruitless
struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill promises made by the rich
and ignorant</quote>; <emphasis role='firstterm'>flowchart</emphasis> becomes
<quote>to obfuscate a problem with esoteric cartoons</quote>.  Revised and
expanded from <citetitle>The Devil's DP Dictionary</citetitle>, McGraw-Hill

<abstract><para>The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a
great deal of computer- and hacker-related folklore with good writing and a
few well-chosen cartoons.  She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom.  Unfortunately, a number of small errors and awkwardnesses suggest
that she didn't have the final manuscript checked over by a native speaker;
the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing, and at least one
classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold here under <link

incomplete and badly mangled form.  Nevertheless, this book is a win overall

<abstract><para>This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the
adventure of the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle.  It
is an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset &mdash; although
largely the hardware hacker &mdash; done by a complete outsider.  It is a bit
thin in spots, but with enough technical information to be entertaining to the
serious hacker while providing non-technical people a view of what day-to-day
life can be like &mdash; the fun, the excitement, the disasters.  During one
period, when the microcode and logic were glitching at the nanosecond level,
one of the overworked engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on
his terminal as his letter of resignation: <quote>I am going to a commune in
Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a

<abstract><para>The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things
about Unix that tutorials and technical books won't.  The result is gossipy,
funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable.  Along the way
they expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and humor to qualify as
a first-class source for these things.  Because so much of today's hackerdom
is involved with Unix, this in turn illuminates many of its in-jokes and
preoccupations.</para></abstract>

about the hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of

notorious crackers into a clear-eyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdom's
dark side.  The principals are Kevin Mitnick, <quote>Pengo</quote> and
<quote>Hagbard</quote> of the Chaos Computer Club, and Robert T. Morris (see
<glossterm>RTM</glossterm>, sense 2).  Markoff and Hafner focus as much on
their psychologies and motivations as on the details of their exploits, but
don't slight the latter.  The result is a balanced and fascinating account,
particularly useful when read immediately before or after Cliff Stoll's <link
linkend="Stoll">The Cuckoo's Egg</link>.  It is especially instructive to
compare RTM, a true hacker who blundered, with the sociopathic phone-freak
Mitnick and the alienated, drug-addled crackers who made the Chaos Club
notorious.  The gulf between <glossterm>wizard</glossterm> and

thousands of hours putting together submissions and criticizing our drafts; we
are deeply grateful.  Some of the most dedicated contributors have been cited

<para>No proprietary software was used during the making of this book.  It was
typeset from XML-DocBook master files created with GNU Emacs and psgml.
Postcript generation was performed under Red Hat Linux using Tim Waugh's
xmlto, Norman Walsh's XSL stylesheets, Daniel Veillard's xsltproc, Sebastian
Rahtz's PassiveTeX macros, the TeTeX distribution of Donald Knuth's TeX
typesetter, and Thomas Rokicki's dvips postprocessor.  Illustrations were
scanned using xsane driving an Epson 1250 scanner, then touched up with
gimp.</para>
