<h1 class="centered">Mirroring and Redistributing the Jargon File</h1>

<p>The Jargon File is in the public domain, to be freely used, shared, and
modified. There are (by intention) no legal restraints on what you can do
with it, but there are conventions about its proper use which help people a
lot of get the best use out of it, and minimize hassles for the maintainers.
They're simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the latest version to mirror or redistribute.</li>

<li>Don't mirror or convert by hand!</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage people to mirror the Jargon File WWW resources. Just
copy all the HTML files under the jargon FTP directory at <a
href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/">http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/</a>.
Follow the directions in the <code>INSTALL-HTML</code> file. And tell
us that you've done it so we can add you to our <a
href="mirrorlist.html">list of mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>Most links in the Jargon subweb are relative (in particular, all links to
files below the Jargon File Resources directory are local). Thus, it
shouldn't be necessary for you to edit URLs in the copy.</p>

<p>Note: <em>we strongly discourage</em> mirroring by hand, it leads to old
mirrors not getting updated later on. It's a lot smarter to write a script
that periodically re-copies everything...say, once every 30 or 60 days (or,
better yet, checks more often to see if a re-copy is needed by comparing file
dates). That way you'll stay up to date.</p>

<p>We're told that the following command mirrors the Jargon resources to a
specified local-dir:</p>

<pre>
wget -m http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/ -nH --cut-dirs=2 -np -L -P /home/httpd/htdocs/jargon
</pre>

<p>To use this, you'll need to have <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget">wget</a> available in your path.</p>

<h1>Re-distributing the Jargon File</h1>

<p>If you distribute a free Unix (like Linux or one of the free BSD variants)
we encourage you to include the Jargon File HTML version as part of your
system documentation tree.</p>

<h1>Re-packaging the Jargon File</h1>

<p>We also encourage people to repackage the HTML Jargon File content in
their own favorite formats (RTF, FrameMaker, Hypercard, etc.) and
redistribute it. We'll even help you do it. With these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't convert by hand!</li>

<li>Send us a copy of your conversion stylsheet of script.</li>

<li>Please don't publish a printed version.</li>

<li>If you edit the File's content, clearly so indicate!</li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, <em>we strongly discourage</em> hand-hacking. Don't do it! It
only leads to one-off conversions that never get redone and age rapidly,
causing headaches down the road for everyone.</p>

<p>The Jargon File masters are maintained in XML Docbook.  If there 
is an existing converter or stylesheet that will grind out your format,
you're done.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium maintains a page of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Tools/html2things.html">HTML converters</a>
you may be able to use to do most of the donkey-work for your conversion.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you're probably best off learning XSLT and
writing a stylesheet.  While it might be possible to write a script 
to massage the generated HTML into your preferred formart, learning
XSLT would probably be easier.</p>

<p>Once you have a nice polished conversion, send us a pointer to or copy of
your converter. We'll make it available (on this page) so nobody has to do
the work twice.</p>

<p>Please don't publish or distribute printed versions of the Jargon File. We
can't legally stop you, but you shouldn't do it anyway. The File has a paper
publisher (MIT Press) and a paper version, <cite>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</cite>. They were good sports about the electronic re-distribution
rights -- let's not make them regret that.</p>

<p>Finally, if you edit the Jargon File's actual content in any substantive
way, please stick a notice right up front on your copy explaining who did it
and why. We'd rather not be held responsible for anyone else's editing --
it's enough work being responsible for our own!</p>
