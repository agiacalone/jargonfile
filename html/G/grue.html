   in the game <a href="../Z/Zork.html"><i class="glossterm">Zork</i></a> (Dave Lebling took the name from
   Jack Vance's <i class="citetitle">Dying Earth</i> fantasies) and used in
   several other <a href="../I/Infocom.html"><i class="glossterm">Infocom</i></a> games as a hint that you
   should perhaps look for a lamp, torch or some type of light source.
   Wandering into a dark area would cause the game to prompt you, &#8220;<span class="quote">It is
   very dark.  If you continue you are likely to be eaten by a grue.</span>&#8221;
   If you failed to locate a light source within the next couple of moves this
   would indeed be the case.</p><p>The grue, according to scholars of the Great Underground Empire, is a
   sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the earth.  Its favorite
   diet is either adventurers or enchanters, but its insatiable appetite is
   tempered by its extreme fear of light. No grues have ever been seen by the
   light of day, and only a few have been observed in their underground
   lairs. Of those who have seen grues, few have survived their fearsome jaws
   to tell the tale. Grues have sickly glowing fur, fish-mouthed faces, sharp
   claws and fangs, and an uncontrollable tendency to slaver and gurgle. They
   are certainly the most evil-tempered of all creatures; to say they are
   touchy is a dangerous understatement. &#8220;<span class="quote">Sour as a grue</span>&#8221; is a
   common expression, even among grues themselves.</p><p>All this folklore is widely known among hackers.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="grovel.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../G.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="grunge.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">grovel </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> grunge</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
