   &#8216;magic word&#8217;.  This comes from <a href="../A/ADVENT.html"><i class="glossterm">ADVENT</i></a>,
   in which the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to
   collect the treasures you find there.  If you type <span class="firstterm">xyzzy</span> at the appropriate time, you can move
   instantly between two otherwise distant points.  If, therefore, you
   encounter some bit of <a href="../M/magic.html"><i class="glossterm">magic</i></a>, you might remark on
   this quite succinctly by saying simply &#8220;<span class="quote">Xyzzy!</span>&#8221;
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has
   protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you
   do it anyway.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Xyzzy!</span>&#8221; It's traditional for xyzzy to
   be an <a href="../E/Easter-egg.html"><i class="glossterm">Easter egg</i></a> in games with text
   interfaces.</p><p>Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented no-op command
   on several OSes; in Data General's AOS/VS, for example, it would typically
   respond &#8220;<span class="quote">Nothing happens</span>&#8221;, just as
   <a href="../A/ADVENT.html"><i class="glossterm">ADVENT</i></a> did if the magic was invoked at the wrong
   spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word.  In
   more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds &#8220;<span class="quote">Twice as
   much happens</span>&#8221;.</p><p>Early versions of the popular &#8216;minesweeper&#8217; game under
   Microsoft Windows had a cheat mode triggered by the command
   &#8216;xyzzy&lt;enter&gt;&lt;right-shift&gt;&#8217; that turns the top-left
   pixel of the screen different colors depending on whether or not the cursor
   is over a bomb.  This feature temporarily disappeared in Windows 98, but
   reappeared in Windows 2000.</p><p>The following passage from <i class="citetitle">The Wonderful Wizard of
   Oz</i> by L. Frank Baum, suggesting a possible pre-ADVENT origin,
   has recently come to light: &#8220;<span class="quote">Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!</span>&#8221; said
   Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.  This ended the saying of the
   charm, and they heard a great chattering and flapping of wings, as the band
   of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.</p><p>The text can be viewed at <a href="    ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext93/wizoz10.txt" target="_top">
