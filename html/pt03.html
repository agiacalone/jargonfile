Space’ spoof of SF genre traditions has been popular among
hackers ever since the original British radio show.  Read it if only
to learn about Vogons (see <a href="B/bogon.html"><i class="glossterm">bogon</i></a>) and the
significance of the number 42 (see <a href="R/random-numbers.html"><i class="glossterm">random numbers</i></a>)
— and why the winningest chess program of 1990 was called
‘Deep Thought’.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Geoffrey"/><p>[Geoffrey] <span class="title"><i>The Tao of Programming</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">James</span> <span class="surname">Geoffrey</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Infobooks. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1987. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-931137-07-1. </span><p>This gentle, funny spoof of the <i class="citetitle">Tao Te

at the Model Railroad Club and the early days of the microcomputer revolution.
He never understood Unix or the networksthough, and his enshrinement of
Richard Stallman as “<span class="quote">the last true hacker</span>” turns out (thankfully)
to have been quite misleading.  Despite being a bit dated and containing some
minor errors (many fixed in the paperback edition), this remains a useful and
stimulating book that captures the feel of several important hacker
subcultures.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Kelly-Bootle"/><p>[Kelly-Bootle] <span class="title"><i>The Computer Contradictionary</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Stan</span> <span class="surname">Kelly-Bootle</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">MIT Press. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1995. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-262-61112-0. </span><p>This pastiche of Ambrose Bierce's famous work is similar in
format to the Jargon File (and quotes several entries from TNHD-2) but
somewhat different in tone and intent.  It is more satirical and less
anthropological, and is largely a product of the author's literate and quirky
imagination.  For example, it defines <span class="firstterm">computer
science</span> as “<span class="quote">a study akin to numerology and astrology, but
lacking the precision of the former and the success of the latter</span>” and
<span class="firstterm">implementation</span> as “<span class="quote">The fruitless
struggle by the talented and underpaid to fulfill promises made by the rich
and ignorant</span>”; <span class="firstterm">flowchart</span> becomes
“<span class="quote">to obfuscate a problem with esoteric cartoons</span>”.  Revised and
expanded from <i class="citetitle">The Devil's DP Dictionary</i>, McGraw-Hill
1981, ISBN 0-07-034022-6; that work had some stylistic influence on
TNHD-1.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Jennings"/><p>[Jennings] <span class="title"><i>The Devouring Fungus: Tales from the Computer Age</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Karla</span> <span class="surname">Jennings</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Norton. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1990. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-393-30732-8. </span><p>The author of this pioneering compendium knits together a
great deal of computer- and hacker-related folklore with good writing and a
few well-chosen cartoons.  She has a keen eye for the human aspects of the
lore and is very good at illuminating the psychology and evolution of
hackerdom.  Unfortunately, a number of small errors and awkwardnesses suggest
that she didn't have the final manuscript checked over by a native speaker;
the glossary in the back is particularly embarrassing, and at least one
classic tale (the Magic Switch story, retold here under <a href="magic-story.html" title="A Story About ‘Magic'">A Story About Magic</a> in Appendix A) is given in
incomplete and badly mangled form.  Nevertheless, this book is a win overall
and can be enjoyed by hacker and non-hacker alike.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Kidder"/><p>[Kidder] <span class="title"><i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Tracy</span> <span class="surname">Kidder</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Avon. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1982. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-380-59931-7. </span><p>This book (a 1982 Pulitzer Prize winner) documents the
adventure of the design of a new Data General computer, the MV-8000 Eagle.  It
is an amazingly well-done portrait of the hacker mindset — although
largely the hardware hacker — done by a complete outsider.  It is a bit
thin in spots, but with enough technical information to be entertaining to the
serious hacker while providing non-technical people a view of what day-to-day
life can be like — the fun, the excitement, the disasters.  During one
period, when the microcode and logic were glitching at the nanosecond level,
one of the overworked engineers departed the company, leaving behind a note on
his terminal as his letter of resignation: “<span class="quote">I am going to a commune in
Vermont and will deal with no unit of time shorter than a
season.</span>”</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Libes"/><p>[Libes] <span class="title"><i>Life with UNIX: a Guide for Everyone</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Don</span> <span class="surname">Libes</span>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Sandy</span> <span class="surname">Ressler</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Prentice-Hall. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1989. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-13-536657-7. </span><p>The authors of this book set out to tell you all the things
about Unix that tutorials and technical books won't.  The result is gossipy,
funny, opinionated, downright weird in spots, and invaluable.  Along the way
they expose you to enough of Unix's history, folklore and humor to qualify as
a first-class source for these things.  Because so much of today's hackerdom
is involved with Unix, this in turn illuminates many of its in-jokes and
preoccupations.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Vinge"/><p>[Vinge] <span class="title"><i>True Names ... and Other Dangers</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Vernor</span> <span class="surname">Vinge</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Baen Books. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1987. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-671-65363-6. </span><p>Hacker demigod Richard Stallman used to say that the title
story of this book “<span class="quote">expresses the spirit of hacking best</span>”.  Until
the subject of the next entry came out, it was hard to even nominate another
contender.  The other stories in this collection are also fine work by an
author who has since won multiple Hugos and is one of today's very best
practitioners of hard SF.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Stephenson"/><p>[Stephenson] <span class="title"><i>Snow Crash</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Neal</span> <span class="surname">Stephenson</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Bantam. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1992. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-553-56261-4. </span><p>Stephenson's epic, comic cyberpunk novel is deeply knowing
about the hacker psychology and its foibles in a way no other author of
fiction has ever even approached.  His imagination, his grasp of the relevant
technical details, and his ability to communicate the excitement of hacking
and its results are astonishing, delightful, and (so far)
unsurpassed.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Markoff-ampersand-Hafner"/><p>[Markoff-ampersand-Hafner] <span class="title"><i>Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Katie</span> <span class="surname">Hafner</span>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">John</span> <span class="surname">Markoff</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Simon &amp;
Schuster. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1991. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-671-68322-5. </span><p> This book gathers narratives about the careers of three
notorious crackers into a clear-eyed but sympathetic portrait of hackerdom's
dark side.  The principals are Kevin Mitnick, “<span class="quote">Pengo</span>” and
“<span class="quote">Hagbard</span>” of the Chaos Computer Club, and Robert T. Morris (see
<a href="R/RTM.html"><i class="glossterm">RTM</i></a>, sense 2).  Markoff and Hafner focus as much on
their psychologies and motivations as on the details of their exploits, but
don't slight the latter.  The result is a balanced and fascinating account,
particularly useful when read immediately before or after Cliff Stoll's <a href="pt03.html#Stoll">The Cuckoo's Egg</a>.  It is especially instructive to
compare RTM, a true hacker who blundered, with the sociopathic phone-freak
Mitnick and the alienated, drug-addled crackers who made the Chaos Club
notorious.  The gulf between <a href="W/wizard.html"><i class="glossterm">wizard</i></a> and
<a href="W/wannabee.html"><i class="glossterm">wannabee</i></a> has seldom been made more
obvious.</p></p></div><div class="biblioentry"><a id="Stoll"/><p>[Stoll] <span class="title"><i>The Cuckoo's Egg</i>. </span><span class="author"><span class="firstname">Clifford</span> <span class="surname">Stoll</span>. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">Doubleday. </span></span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1989. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-385-24946-2. </span><p>Clifford Stoll's absorbing tale of how he tracked Markus Hess
and the Chaos Club cracking ring nicely illustrates the difference between
‘hacker' and ‘cracker'.  Stoll's portrait of himself, his lady
Martha, and his friends at Berkeley and on the Internet paints a marvelously
vivid picture of how hackers and the people around them like to live and how
they think.</p></p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Z/zorkmid.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="appendixa.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">zorkmid </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Appendix A. Hacker Folklore</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
