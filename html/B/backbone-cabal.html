   <a href="../G/Great-Renaming.html"><i class="glossterm">Great Renaming</i></a> and reined in the chaos of
   <a href="../U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a> during most of the 1980s.  During most of its
   lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied
   its own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy to their
   secrets to respond &#8220;<span class="quote">There is no Cabal</span>&#8221; whenever the existence
   or activities of the group were speculated on in public.</p><p>The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery.  Even a
   decade after the cabal <a href="../M/mailing-list.html"><i class="glossterm">mailing list</i></a> disbanded in
   late 1988 following a bitter internal catfight, many people believed (or
   claimed to believe) that it had not actually disbanded but only gone deeper
   underground with its power intact.</p><p>This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about
   various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over
   the Usenet or Internet.  These paranoias were later satirized in ways that
   took on a life of their own.  See <a href="../E/Eric-Conspiracy.html"><i class="glossterm">Eric Conspiracy</i></a>
   for one example.  Part of the background for this kind of humor is that
   many hackers cultivate a fondness for conspiracy theory considered as a
   kind of surrealist art; see the bibliography entry om
   <i class="citetitle">Illuminatus!</i> for the novel that launched this
   trend.</p><p>See <a href="../N/NANA.html"><i class="glossterm">NANA</i></a> for the subsequent history of
