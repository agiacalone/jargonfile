   initialize the operating system on a machine.  This usage is no longer
   jargon (having passed into techspeak) but has given rise to some
   derivatives that are still jargon.</p><p>The derivative <span class="firstterm">reboot</span> implies
   that the machine hasn't been down for long, or that the boot is a
   <a href="bounce.html"><i class="glossterm">bounce</i></a> (sense 4) intended to clear some state of
   <a href="../W/wedgitude.html"><i class="glossterm">wedgitude</i></a>.  This is sometimes used of human thought
   processes, as in the following exchange: &#8220;<span class="quote">You've lost me.</span>&#8221;
   &#8220;<span class="quote">OK, reboot.  Here's the theory....</span>&#8221;</p><p>This term is also found in the variants <span class="firstterm">cold boot</span> (from power-off condition) and
   <span class="firstterm">warm boot</span> (with the CPU and all
   devices already powered up, as after a hardware reset or software
   crash).</p><p>Another variant: <span class="firstterm">soft boot</span>,
   reinitialization of only part of a system, under control of other software
   still running: &#8220;<span class="quote">If you're running the <a href="../M/mess-dos.html"><i class="glossterm">mess-dos</i></a>
   emulator, control-alt-insert will cause a soft-boot of the emulator, while
   leaving the rest of the system running.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Opposed to this there is <span class="firstterm">hard
   boot</span>, which connotes hostility towards or frustration with the
   machine being booted: &#8220;<span class="quote">I'll have to hard-boot this losing
   Sun.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">I recommend booting it hard.</span>&#8221; One often
   hard-boots by performing a <a href="../P/power-cycle.html"><i class="glossterm">power cycle</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>Historical note: this term derives from <span class="firstterm">bootstrap loader</span>, a short program that was read
   in from cards or paper tape, or toggled in from the front panel switches.
   This program was always very short (great efforts were expended on making
   it short in order to minimize the labor and chance of error involved in
   toggling it in), but was just smart enough to read in a slightly more
   complex program (usually from a card or paper tape reader), to which it
   handed control; this program in turn was smart enough to read the
   application or operating system from a magnetic tape drive or disk drive.
   Thus, in successive steps, the computer &#8216;pulled itself up by its
   bootstraps&#8217; to a useful operating state.  Nowadays the bootstrap is
   usually found in ROM or EPROM, and reads the first stage in from a fixed
   location on the disk, called the &#8216;boot block&#8217;.  When this
   program gains control, it is powerful enough to load the actual OS and hand
   control over to it.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="book-titles.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../B.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Borg.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">book titles </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Borg</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
