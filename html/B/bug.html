   better known for inventing <a href="../C/COBOL.html"><i class="glossterm">COBOL</i></a>) liked to tell a
   story in which a technician solved a <a href="../G/glitch.html"><i class="glossterm">glitch</i></a> in the
   Harvard Mark II machine by pulling an actual insect out from between the
   contacts of one of its relays, and she subsequently promulgated
   <a href="bug.html"><i class="glossterm">bug</i></a> in its hackish sense as a joke about the
   incident (though, as she was careful to admit, she was not there when it
   happened).  For many years the logbook associated with the incident and the
   actual bug in question (a moth) sat in a display case at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center (NSWC).  The entire story, with a picture of the logbook and
   the moth taped into it, is recorded in the <i class="citetitle">Annals of the History
   of Computing</i>, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1981), pp. 285--286.</p><p>The text of the log entry (from September 9, 1947), reads &#8220;<span class="quote">1545
   Relay #70 Panel F (moth) in relay.  First actual case of bug being
   found</span>&#8221;.  This wording establishes that the term was already in use
   at the time in its current specific sense &#8212; and Hopper herself
   reports that the term <span class="firstterm">bug</span> was
   regularly applied to problems in radar electronics during WWII.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="hopper-bug"/><img src="../graphics/bugpic-color.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>The &#8216;original bug&#8217; (the caption date is incorrect)</p></div></div><p>Indeed, the use of <span class="firstterm">bug</span> to mean
   an industrial defect was already established in Thomas Edison's time, and a
   more specific and rather modern use can be found in an electrical handbook
   from 1896 (<i class="citetitle">Hawkin's New Catechism of Electricity</i>,
   Theo. Audel &amp; Co.)  which says: &#8220;<span class="quote">The term &#8216;bug&#8217; is
   used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the
   connections or working of electric apparatus.</span>&#8221; It further notes that
   the term is &#8220;<span class="quote">said to have originated in quadruplex telegraphy and
   have been transferred to all electric apparatus.</span>&#8221;</p><p>The latter observation may explain a common folk etymology of the
   term; that it came from telephone company usage, in which &#8220;<span class="quote">bugs in a
   telephone cable</span>&#8221; were blamed for noisy lines.  Though this
   derivation seems to be mistaken, it may well be a distorted memory of a
   joke first current among <span class="emphasis"><em>telegraph</em></span> operators more than
   a century ago!</p><p>Or perhaps not a joke.  Historians of the field inform us that the
   term &#8220;<span class="quote">bug</span>&#8221; was regularly used in the early days of telegraphy
   to refer to a variety of semi-automatic telegraphy keyers that would send a
   string of dots if you held them down.  In fact, the Vibroplex keyers (which
   were among the most common of this type) even had a graphic of a beetle on
   them (and still do)!  While the ability to send repeated dots automatically
   was very useful for professional morse code operators, these were also
   significantly trickier to use than the older manual keyers, and it could
   take some practice to ensure one didn't introduce extraneous dots into the
   code by holding the key down a fraction too long.  In the hands of an
   inexperienced operator, a Vibroplex &#8220;<span class="quote">bug</span>&#8221; on the line could
   mean that a lot of garbled Morse would soon be coming your way.</p><p>Further, the term &#8220;<span class="quote">bug</span>&#8221; has long been used among radio
   technicians to describe a device that converts electromagnetic field
   variations into acoustic signals.  It is used to trace radio interference
   and look for dangerous radio emissions.  Radio community usage derives from
   the roach-like shape of the first versions used by 19th century physicists.
   The first versions consisted of a coil of wire (roach body), with the two
   wire ends sticking out and bent back to nearly touch forming a spark gap
   (roach antennae).  The bug is to the radio technician what the stethoscope
   is to the stereotypical medical doctor.  This sense is almost certainly
   ancestral to modern use of &#8220;<span class="quote">bug</span>&#8221; for a covert monitoring
   device, but may also have contributed to the use of &#8220;<span class="quote">bug</span>&#8221; for
   the effects of radio interference itself.</p><p>Actually, use of <span class="firstterm">bug</span> in the
   general sense of a disruptive event goes back to Shakespeare!  (Henry VI,
   part III - Act V, Scene II: King Edward: &#8220;<span class="quote">So, lie thou there. Die
   thou; and die our fear; For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.</span>&#8221;)
   In the first edition of Samuel Johnson's dictionary one meaning of
   <span class="firstterm">bug</span> is &#8220;<span class="quote">A frightful object; a
   walking spectre</span>&#8221;; this is traced to &#8216;bugbear&#8217;, a Welsh
   term for a variety of mythological monster which (to complete the circle)
   has recently been reintroduced into the popular lexicon through fantasy
   role-playing games.</p><p>In any case, in jargon the word almost never refers to insects.  Here
   is a plausible conversation that never actually happened: &#8220;<span class="quote">There is a
   bug in this ant farm!</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">What do you mean?  I don't see any
   ants in it.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">That's the bug.</span>&#8221;</p><p>A careful discussion of the etymological issues can be found in a
   paper by Fred R. Shapiro, 1987, &#8220;<span class="quote">Entomology of the Computer Bug:
   History and Folklore</span>&#8221;, American Speech 62(4):376-378.</p><p>[There has been a widespread myth that the original bug was moved to
   the Smithsonian, and an earlier version of this entry so asserted.  A
   correspondent who thought to check discovered that the bug was not there.
   While investigating this in late 1990, your editor discovered that the NSWC
   still had the bug, but had unsuccessfully tried to get the Smithsonian to
   accept it &#8212; and that the present curator of their History of American
   Technology Museum didn't know this and agreed that it would make a
   worthwhile exhibit.  It was moved to the Smithsonian in mid-1991, but due
   to space and money constraints was not actually exhibited for years
   afterwards.  Thus, the process of investigating the original-computer-bug
   bug fixed it in an entirely unexpected way, by making the myth true!
