The universal data sink (originally, the mythical receptacle used
   to catch bits when they fall off the end of a register during a shift
   instruction).  Discarded, lost, or destroyed data is said to have <span class="firstterm">gone to the bit bucket</span>.  On
   <a href="../U/Unix.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix</i></a>, often used for
   <a href="../0/dev-null.html"><i class="glossterm">/dev/null</i></a>.  Sometimes amplified as <span class="firstterm">the Great Bit Bucket in the Sky</span>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. The place where all lost mail and news messages eventually go.
   The selection is performed according to 
   <a href="../F/Finagles-Law.html"><i class="glossterm">Finagle's Law</i></a>; important mail is much more likely to end up in the bit
   bucket than junk mail, which has an almost 100% probability of getting
   delivered.  Routing to the bit bucket is automatically performed by
   mail-transfer agents, news systems, and the lower layers of the network.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 3. The ideal location for all unwanted mail responses: &#8220;<span class="quote">Flames
   about this article to the bit bucket.</span>&#8221; Such a request is guaranteed
   to overflow one's mailbox with flames.  </p></dd><dd><p> 4. Excuse for all mail that has not been sent.  &#8220;<span class="quote">I mailed you
   those figures last week; they must have landed in the bit bucket.</span>&#8221;
   Compare <a href="black-hole.html"><i class="glossterm">black hole</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>This term is used purely in jest.  It is based on the fanciful notion
   that bits are objects that are not destroyed but only misplaced.  This
   appears to have been a mutation of an earlier term &#8216;bit box&#8217;,
   about which the same legend was current; old-time hackers also report that
   trainees used to be told that when the CPU stored bits into memory it was
   actually pulling them &#8220;<span class="quote">out of the bit box</span>&#8221;.  See also 
   <a href="../C/chad-box.html"><i class="glossterm">chad box</i></a>.</p><p>Another variant of this legend has it that, as a consequence of the
   &#8220;<span class="quote">parity preservation law</span>&#8221;, the number of 1 bits that go to the
   bit bucket must equal the number of 0 bits.  Any imbalance results in bits
   filling up the bit bucket.  A qualified computer technician can empty a
   full bit bucket as part of scheduled maintenance.</p><p>The source for all these meanings, is, historically, the fact that
   the <a href="../C/chad-box.html"><i class="glossterm">chad box</i></a> on a paper-tape punch was sometimes
   called a bit bucket.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="crunchly75-10-04"/><img src="../graphics/75-10-04.png"/><div class="caption"><p>A literal <a href="bit-bucket.html"><i class="glossterm">bit bucket</i></a>.</p><p>(The next cartoon in the Crunchly saga is
