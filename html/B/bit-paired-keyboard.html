   non-standard keyboard layout that seems to have originated with the
   Teletype ASR-33 and remained common for several years on early computer
   equipment.  The ASR-33 was a mechanical device (see
   <a href="../E/EOU.html"><i class="glossterm">EOU</i></a>), so the only way to generate the character
   codes from keystrokes was by some physical linkage.  The design of the
   ASR-33 assigned each character key a basic pattern that could be modified
   by flipping bits if the SHIFT or the CTRL key was pressed.  In order to
   avoid making the thing even more of a kluge than it already was, the design
   had to group characters that shared the same basic bit pattern on one
   key.</p><p>Looking at the ASCII chart, we find:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">
high  low bits
bits  0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001
 010        !    &quot;    #    $    %    &amp;    '    (    )
 011   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
</pre></td></tr></table><p>This is why the characters !&quot;#$%&amp;'() appear where they do on a
   Teletype (thankfully, they didn't use shift-0 for space). The Teletype
   Model 33 was actually designed before ASCII existed, and was originally
   intended to use a code that contained these two rows:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">
      low bits
high  0000  0010  0100  0110  1000  1010  1100  1110
bits     0001  0011  0101  0111  1001  1011  1101  1111
  10   )  ! bel #  $  % wru &amp;  *  (  &quot;  :  ?  _  ,   .
  11   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  '  ;  /  - esc del
</pre></td></tr></table><p>The result would have been something closer to a normal keyboard.
   But as it happened, Teletype had to use a lot of persuasion just to keep
   ASCII, and the Model 33 keyboard, from looking like this instead:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">
          !  &quot;  ?  $  '  &amp;  -  (  )  ;  :  *  /  ,  .
       0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  +  ~  &lt;  &gt;  ×  |
</pre></td></tr></table><p>Teletype's was <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the weirdest variant of the
   <a href="../Q/QWERTY.html"><i class="glossterm">QWERTY</i></a> layout widely seen, by the way; that prize
   should probably go to one of several (differing) arrangements on IBM's even
   clunkier 026 and 029 card punches.</p><p>When electronic terminals became popular, in the early 1970s, there
   was no agreement in the industry over how the keyboards should be laid out.
   Some vendors opted to emulate the Teletype keyboard, while others used the
   flexibility of electronic circuitry to make their product look like an
   office typewriter.  Either choice was supported by the ANSI computer
   keyboard standard, X4.14-1971, which referred to the alternatives as
   &#8220;<span class="quote">logical bit pairing</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="quote">typewriter
   pairing</span>&#8221;. These alternatives became known as <span class="firstterm">bit-paired</span> and <span class="firstterm">typewriter-paired</span> keyboards.  To a hacker, the
   bit-paired keyboard seemed far more logical &#8212; and because most
   hackers in those days had never learned to touch-type, there was little
   pressure from the pioneering users to adapt keyboards to the typewriter
   standard.</p><p>The doom of the bit-paired keyboard was the large-scale introduction
   of the computer terminal into the normal office environment, where
   out-and-out technophobes were expected to use the equipment.  The <span class="firstterm">typewriter-paired</span> standard became universal,
   X4.14 was superseded by X4.23-1982, <span class="firstterm">bit-paired</span> hardware was quickly junked or
   relegated to dusty corners, and both terms passed into disuse.</p><p>However, in countries without a long history of touch typing, the
   argument against the bit-paired keyboard layout was weak or nonexistent. As
   a result, the standard Japanese keyboard, used on PCs, Unix boxen
   etc. still has all of the !&quot;#$%&amp;'() characters above the numbers in the
   ASR-33 layout.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="bit-twiddling.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../B.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bitblt.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">bit twiddling </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> bitblt</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
