   experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many years
   was the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers.  Edsger W. Dijkstra
   observed in <i class="citetitle">Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal
   Perspective</i> that &#8220;<span class="quote">It is practically impossible to teach
   good programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC:
   as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of
   regeneration.</span>&#8221; This is another case (like
   <a href="../P/Pascal.html"><i class="glossterm">Pascal</i></a>) of the cascading
   <a href="../L/lossage.html"><i class="glossterm">lossage</i></a> that happens when a language deliberately
   designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously.  A novice can
   write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily;
   writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits
   that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.  This
   wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on
   low-end micros in the 1980s.  As it is, it probably ruined tens of
   thousands of potential wizards.</p></dd><dd><p>[1995: Some languages called &#8220;<span class="quote">BASIC</span>&#8221; aren't quite this
