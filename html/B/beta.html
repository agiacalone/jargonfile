   buggy).</p></dd><dd><p>Historical note: More formally, to beta-test is to test a pre-release
   (potentially unreliable) version of a piece of software by making it
   available to selected (or self-selected) customers and users.  This term
   derives from early 1960s terminology for product cycle checkpoints, first
   used at IBM but later standard throughout the industry.  <span class="firstterm">Alpha Test</span> was the unit, module, or component
   test phase; <span class="firstterm">Beta Test</span> was initial
   system test.  These themselves came from earlier A- and B-tests for
   hardware.  The A-test was a feasibility and manufacturability evaluation
   done before any commitment to design and development.  The B-test was a
   demonstration that the engineering model functioned as specified.  The
   C-test (corresponding to today's beta) was the B-test performed on early
   samples of the production design, and the D test was the C test repeated
   after the model had been in production a while.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Berzerkeley.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../B.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="BFI.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Berzerkeley </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> BFI</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
