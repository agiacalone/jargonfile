   that may be achieved when one is hacking (this is why every good hacker is
   part mystic).  Ability to enter such concentration at will correlates
   strongly with wizardliness; it is one of the most important skills learned

   <span class="firstterm">deep hack mode</span>.</p><p>Being yanked out of hack mode (see 
   <a href="../P/priority-interrupt.html"><i class="glossterm">priority interrupt</i></a>) may be experienced as a physical shock, and the
   sensation of being in hack mode is more than a little habituating.  The
   intensity of this experience is probably by itself sufficient explanation
   for the existence of hackers, and explains why many resist being promoted
   out of positions where they can code.  See also
   <a href="../C/cyberspace.html"><i class="glossterm">cyberspace</i></a> (sense 3).</p><p>Some aspects of hacker etiquette will appear quite odd to an observer
   unaware of the high value placed on hack mode.  For example, if someone
   appears at your door, it is perfectly okay to hold up a hand (without
   turning one's eyes away from the screen) to avoid being interrupted.  One
   may read, type, and interact with the computer for quite some time before
   further acknowledging the other's presence (of course, he or she is
   reciprocally free to leave without a word).  The understanding is that you
   might be in <a href="hack-mode.html"><i class="glossterm">hack mode</i></a> with a lot of delicate
   <a href="../S/state.html"><i class="glossterm">state</i></a> (sense 2) in your head, and you dare not
   <a href="../S/swap.html"><i class="glossterm">swap</i></a> that context out until you have reached a good
   point to pause.
