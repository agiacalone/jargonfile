A legendary collection of neat
   mathematical and programming hacks contributed by many people at MIT and
   elsewhere.  (The title of the memo really is &#8220;<span class="quote">HAKMEM</span>&#8221;, which
   is a 6-letterism for &#8216;hacks memo&#8217;.)  Some of them are very
   useful techniques, powerful theorems, or interesting unsolved problems, but
   most fall into the category of mathematical and computer trivia.  Here is a
   sampling of the entries (with authors), slightly paraphrased:</p><p>Item 41 (Gene Salamin): There are exactly 23,000 prime numbers less
   than
   <tt class="literal">2<sup>18</sup></tt>.</p><p>Item 46 (Rich Schroeppel): The most <span class="emphasis"><em>probable</em></span>
   suit distribution in bridge hands is 4-4-3-2, as compared to 4-3-3-3, which
   is the most <span class="emphasis"><em>evenly</em></span> distributed.  This is because the
   world likes to have unequal numbers: a thermodynamic effect saying things
   will not be in the state of lowest energy, but in the state of lowest
   disordered energy.</p><p>Item 81 (Rich Schroeppel): Count the magic squares of order 5 (that
   is, all the 5-by-5 arrangements of the numbers from 1 to 25 such that all
   rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number).  There are about
   320 million, not counting those that differ only by rotation and
   reflection.</p><p>Item 154 (Bill Gosper): The myth that any given programming language
   is machine independent is easily exploded by computing the sum of powers of
   2.  If the result loops with period <tt class="literal">= 1</tt>
   with sign <tt class="literal">+</tt>, you are on a sign-magnitude
   machine.  If the result loops with period <tt class="literal">=
   1</tt> at <tt class="literal">-1</tt>, you are on a
   twos-complement machine.  If the result loops with period greater than 1,
   including the beginning, you are on a ones-complement machine.  If the
   result loops with period greater than 1, not including the beginning, your
   machine isn't binary &#8212; the pattern should tell you the base.  If you
   run out of memory, you are on a string or bignum system.  If arithmetic
   overflow is a fatal error, some fascist pig with a read-only mind is trying
   to enforce machine independence.  But the very ability to trap overflow is
   machine dependent.  By this strategy, consider the universe, or, more
   precisely, algebra: Let <tt class="literal">X =</tt> the sum of
   many powers of 2 = ...111111 (base 2).  Now add
   <tt class="literal">X</tt> to itself: <tt class="literal">X + X
   =</tt> ...111110.  Thus, <tt class="literal">2X = X -
   1</tt>, so <tt class="literal">X = -1</tt>.  Therefore
   algebra is run on a machine (the universe) that is two's-complement.</p><p>Item 174 (Bill Gosper and Stuart Nelson): 21963283741 is the only
   number such that if you represent it on the <a href="../P/PDP-10.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-10</i></a>
   as both an integer and a floating-point number, the bit patterns of the two
   representations are identical.</p><p>Item 176 (Gosper): The &#8220;<span class="quote">banana phenomenon</span>&#8221; was
   encountered when processing a character string by taking the last 3 letters
   typed out, searching for a random occurrence of that sequence in the text,
   taking the letter following that occurrence, typing it out, and iterating.
   This ensures that every 4-letter string output occurs in the original.  The
   program typed BANANANANANANANA.... We note an ambiguity in the
   phrase, &#8220;<span class="quote">the <tt class="literal">N</tt>th occurrence
   of.</span>&#8221; In one sense, there are five 00's in 0000000000; in another,
   there are nine.  The editing program TECO finds five.  Thus it finds only
   the first ANA in BANANA, and is thus obligated to type N next.  By Murphy's
   Law, there is but one NAN, thus forcing A, and thus a loop.  An option to
   find overlapped instances would be useful, although it would require
   backing up <tt class="literal">N</tt> &#8722; 1 characters before
   seeking the next <tt class="literal">N</tt>-character
   string.</p><p>Note: This last item refers to a 
   <a href="../D/Dissociated-Press.html"><i class="glossterm">Dissociated Press</i></a> implementation.  See also 
   <a href="../B/banana-problem.html"><i class="glossterm">banana problem</i></a>.</p><p>HAKMEM also contains some rather more complicated mathematical and
   technical items, but these examples show some of its fun flavor.</p><p>An HTML transcription of the entire document is available at <a href="http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html" target="_top">http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html</a>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="hairy.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../H.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hakspek.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">hairy </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> hakspek</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
