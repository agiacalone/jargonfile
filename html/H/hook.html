   additions or changes by a user.  For example, a simple program that prints
   numbers might always print them in base 10, but a more flexible version
   would let a variable determine what base to use; setting the variable to 5
   would make the program print numbers in base 5.  The variable is a simple
   hook.  An even more flexible program might examine the variable and treat a
   value of 16 or less as the base to use, but treat any other number as the
   address of a user-supplied routine for printing a number.  This is a
   <a href="hairy.html"><i class="glossterm">hairy</i></a> but powerful hook; one can then write a
   routine to print numbers as Roman numerals, say, or as Hebrew characters,
   and plug it into the program through the hook.  Often the difference
   between a good program and a superb one is that the latter has useful hooks
   in judiciously chosen places.  Both may do the original job about equally
   well, but the one with the hooks is much more flexible for future expansion
   of capabilities (<a href="../E/EMACS.html"><i class="glossterm">EMACS</i></a>, for example, is
   <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> hooks).  The term <span class="firstterm">user
   exit</span> is synonymous but much more formal and less hackish.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="honey-pot.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../H.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hop.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">honey pot </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> hop</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
