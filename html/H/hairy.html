   Mathematically literate hackers tend to associate the term
   &#8216;hairy&#8217; with the informal version of this theorem; &#8220;<span class="quote">You
   can't comb a hairy ball smooth.</span>&#8221; (Previous versions of this entry
   associating the above informal statement with the Brouwer fixed-point
   theorem were incorrect.)</p><p>The adjective &#8216;long-haired&#8217; is well-attested to have been
   in slang use among scientists and engineers during the early 1950s; it was
   equivalent to modern <span class="firstterm">hairy</span> senses 1
   and 2, and was very likely ancestral to the hackish use.  In fact the noun
   &#8216;long-hair&#8217; was at the time used to describe a person
   satisfying sense 3.  Both senses probably passed out of use when long hair
   was adopted as a signature trait by the 1960s counterculture, leaving
   hackish <span class="firstterm">hairy</span> as a sort of stunted
   mutant relic.</p><p>In British mainstream use, &#8220;<span class="quote">hairy</span>&#8221; means
   &#8220;<span class="quote">dangerous</span>&#8221;, and consequently, in British programming terms,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">hairy</span>&#8221; may be used to denote complicated and/or
   incomprehensible code, but only if that complexity or incomprehesiveness is
   also considered dangerous.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="hairball.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../H.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="HAKMEM.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">hairball </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> HAKMEM</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
