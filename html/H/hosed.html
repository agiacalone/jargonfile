Used primarily by Unix
   hackers.  Humorous: also implies a condition thought to be relatively easy
   to reverse.  Probably derived from the Canadian slang &#8216;hoser&#8217;
   popularized by the Bob and Doug Mackenzie skits on SCTV, but this usage
   predated SCTV by years in hackerdom (it was certainly already live at CMU
   in the 1970s).  See <a href="hose.html"><i class="glossterm">hose</i></a>.  It is also widely used of
   people in the mainstream sense of &#8216;in an extremely unfortunate
   situation&#8217;.</p><p>Once upon a time, a Cray that had been experiencing periodic
   difficulties crashed, and it was announced to have been hosed.  It was
   discovered that the crash was due to the disconnection of some coolant
   hoses.  The problem was corrected, and users were then assured that
   everything was OK because the system had been rehosed.  See also
