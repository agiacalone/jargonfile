A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
   and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer
   to learn only the minimum necessary.  RFC1392, the <i class="citetitle">Internet
   Users' Glossary</i>, usefully amplifies this as: A person who
   delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a
   system, computers and computer networks in particular.</p></dd><dd><p> 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who
   enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. A person capable of appreciating 
   <a href="hack-value.html"><i class="glossterm">hack value</i></a>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 4. A person who is good at programming quickly.  </p></dd><dd><p> 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does
   work using it or on it; as in &#8216;a Unix hacker&#8217;.  (Definitions 1
   through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)  </p></dd><dd><p> 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One might be an astronomy
   hacker, for example.  </p></dd><dd><p> 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively
   overcoming or circumventing limitations.  </p></dd><dd><p> 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
   information by poking around.  Hence <span class="firstterm">password
   hacker</span>, <span class="firstterm">network hacker</span>.
   The correct term for this sense is <a href="../C/cracker.html"><i class="glossterm">cracker</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>The term &#8216;hacker&#8217; also tends to connote membership in the
   global community defined by the net (see 
   <a href="../T/the-network.html"><i class="glossterm">the network</i></a>.  For discussion of some of the basics of this culture,
   see the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_top"> How
   To Become A Hacker</a> FAQ. It also implies that the person described
   is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see
   <a href="hacker-ethic.html"><i class="glossterm">hacker ethic</i></a>).</p><p>It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
   oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a
   meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly
   welcome.  There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying
   yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll
   quickly be labeled <a href="../B/bogus.html"><i class="glossterm">bogus</i></a>).  See also
   <a href="../G/geek.html"><i class="glossterm">geek</i></a>, <a href="../W/wannabee.html"><i class="glossterm">wannabee</i></a>.</p><p>This term seems to have been first adopted as a badge in the 1960s by
   the hacker culture surrounding TMRC and the MIT AI Lab.  We have a report
   that it was used in a sense close to this entry's by teenage radio hams and
   electronics tinkerers in the mid-1950s.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="hacked-up.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../H.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hacker-ethic.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">hacked up </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> hacker ethic</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
