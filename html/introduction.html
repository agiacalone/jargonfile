of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is included for
background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary; what we describe here
is the language hackers use among themselves for fun, social communication,
and technical debate.  </p><p>The ‘hacker culture’ is actually a loosely networked
collection of subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important
shared experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because hackers
as a group are particularly creative people who define themselves partly by
rejection of ‘normal’ values and working habits, it has unusually
rich and conscious traditions for an intentional culture less than 50 years
old.</p><p>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold places
in the community and expresses shared values and experiences.  Also as usual,
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> knowing the slang (or using it inappropriately)
defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of all in hackish vocabulary)
possibly even a <a href="S/suit.html"><i class="glossterm">suit</i></a>.  All human cultures use slang in
this threefold way — as a tool of communication, and of inclusion, and
of exclusion.</p><p>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps in
the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard to detect
in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are code for shared
states of <span class="emphasis"><em>consciousness</em></span>.  There is a whole range of
altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to high-level hacking
which don't fit into conventional linguistic reality any better than a
Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's surreal <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">trompe
l'oeil</i></span> compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and
hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a simple
example, take the distinction between a <a href="K/kluge.html"><i class="glossterm">kluge</i></a> and an
<a href="E/elegant.html"><i class="glossterm">elegant</i></a> solution, and the differing connotations
attached to each.  The distinction is not only of engineering significance; it
reaches right back into the nature of the generative processes in program
design and asserts something important about two different kinds of
relationship between the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is unusually rich
in implications of this kind, of overtones and undertones that illuminate the
hackish psyche.</p><p>Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive
in their use of language.  These traits seem to be common in young children,
but the conformity-enforcing machine we are pleased to call an educational
system bludgeons them out of most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic
invention in most subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely
unconscious process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as
a game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus display an
almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of language-play with the
discrimination of educated and powerful intelligence.  Further, the electronic
media which knit them together are fluid, ‘hot’ connections, well
adapted to both the dissemination of new slang and the ruthless culling of
weak and superannuated specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps
a uniquely intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.
</p><p>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and anthropological
assumptions.  For example, in the early 1990s it became fashionable to speak
of ‘low-context’ versus ‘high-context’ communication,
and to classify cultures by the preferred context level of their languages and
art forms.  It is usually claimed that low-context communication
(characterized by precision, clarity, and completeness of self-contained
utterances) is typical in cultures which value logic, objectivity,
individualism, and competition; by contrast, high-context communication
(elliptical, emotive, nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated
with cultures which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.
What then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
“<span class="quote">low-context</span>” values, but cultivates an almost absurdly
high-context slang style?</p><p>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a compilation
of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the surrounding culture
— and, in fact, this one is the latest version of an evolving
compilation called the ‘Jargon File’, maintained by hackers
themselves since the early 1970s.  This one (like its ancestors) is primarily
a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect background or
sidelight information on hacker culture that would be awkward to try to
subsume under individual slang definitions.  </p><p>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that the
material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should find at
least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is amusingly
thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use humorous wordplay to
make strong, sometimes combative statements about what they feel.  Some of
these entries reflect the views of opposing sides in disputes that have been
genuinely passionate; this is deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or
pretty up these disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that
<span class="emphasis"><em>everyone's</em></span> sacred cows get gored, impartially.
Compromise is not particularly a hackish virtue, but the honest presentation
of divergent viewpoints is.</p><p>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt it either
necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too, contribute flavor,
and one of this document's major intended audiences — fledgling hackers
already partway inside the culture — will benefit from them.</p><p>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included in
<a href="appendixa.html" title="Appendix A. Hacker Folklore">Appendix A</a>. The ‘outside’
reader's attention is particularly directed to the Portrait of J. Random
Hacker in <a href="appendixb.html" title="Appendix B. A Portrait of J. Random Hacker">Appendix B</a>.  The <a href="pt03.html#bibliography" title="Bibliography">Bibliography</a>, lists some non-technical works
which have either influenced or described the hacker culture.  </p><p>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line between
description and influence can become more than a little blurred.  Earlier
versions of the Jargon File have played a central role in spreading hacker
language and the culture that goes with it to successively larger populations,
and we hope and expect that this one will do likewise. </p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pt01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="distinctions.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Part I. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Of Slang, Jargon, and Techspeak</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
