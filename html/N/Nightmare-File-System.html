In any
   nontrivial network of Suns where there is a lot of NFS cross-mounting, when
   one Sun goes down, the others often freeze up.  Some machine tries to
   access the down one, and (getting no response) repeats indefinitely.  This
   causes it to appear dead to some messages (what is actually happening is
   that it is locked up in what should have been a brief excursion to a higher
   <a href="../S/spl.html"><i class="glossterm">spl</i></a> level).  Then another machine tries to reach
   either the down machine or the pseudo-down machine, and itself becomes
   pseudo-down.  The first machine to discover the down one is now trying both
   to access the down one and to respond to the pseudo-down one, so it is even
   harder to reach.  This situation snowballs very quickly, and soon the
   entire network of machines is frozen &#8212; worst of all, the user can't
   even abort the file access that started the problem!  Many of NFS's
   problems are excused by partisans as being an inevitable result of its
   statelessness, which is held to be a great feature (critics, of course,
   call it a great <a href="../M/misfeature.html"><i class="glossterm">misfeature</i></a>).  (ITS partisans are apt
   to cite this as proof of Unix's alleged bogosity; ITS had a working
   NFS-like shared file system with none of these problems in the early
   1970s.)
