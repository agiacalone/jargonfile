   be reading the net for the U.S. Government's spooks.  Most hackers used to
   think it was mythical but believed in acting as though existed just in
   case.  Since the mid-1990s it has gradually become known that the NSA
   actually does this, quite illegally, through its Echelon program.</p><p>The standard countermeasure is to put loaded phrases like
   &#8216;KGB&#8217;, &#8216;Uzi&#8217;, &#8216;nuclear materials&#8217;,
   &#8216;Palestine&#8217;, &#8216;cocaine&#8217;, and
   &#8216;assassination&#8217; in their <a href="../S/sig-block.html"><i class="glossterm">sig block</i></a>s in a
   (probably futile) attempt to confuse and overload the creature.  The
   <a href="../G/GNU.html"><i class="glossterm">GNU</i></a> version of <a href="../E/EMACS.html"><i class="glossterm">EMACS</i></a> actually
   has a command that randomly inserts a bunch of insidious anarcho-verbiage
   into your edited text.</p><p>As far back as the 1970s there was a mainstream variant of this myth
   involving a &#8216;Trunk Line Monitor&#8217;, which supposedly used speech
   recognition to extract words from telephone trunks.  This is much harder
   than noticing keywords in email, and most of the people who originally
   propagated it had no idea of then-current technology or the storage,
   signal-processing, or speech recognition needs of such a project.  On the
   basis of mass-storage costs alone it would have been cheaper to hire 50
   high-school students and just let them listen in.</p><p>Twenty years and several orders of technological magnitude later,
   however, there are clear indications that the NSA has actually deployed
   such filtering (again, very much against U.S. law).  In 2000, the FBI wants
   to get into this act with its &#8216;Carnivore&#8217; surveillance
   system.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="NP-.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../N.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="NSP.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">NP- </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> NSP</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
