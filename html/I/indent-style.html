   a readable fashion.  There are four major C indent styles, described below;
   all have the aim of making it easier for the reader to visually track the
   scope of control constructs.  They have been inherited by C++ and Java,
   which have C-like syntaxes.  The significant variable is the placement of
   <tt class="literal">{</tt> and <tt class="literal">}</tt> with respect to the
   statement(s) they enclose and to the guard or controlling statement
   (<b class="command">if</b>, <b class="command">else</b>,
   <b class="command">for</b>, <b class="command">while</b>,
   or <b class="command">do</b>) on the block, if any.</p><p><span class="firstterm">K&amp;R style</span> &#8212; Named
   after Kernighan &amp; Ritchie, because the examples in <a href="../K/K-ampersand-R.html"><i class="glossterm">K&amp;R</i></a> are formatted this way.  Also
   called <span class="firstterm">kernel style</span> because the Unix
   kernel is written in it, and the &#8216;One True Brace Style&#8217;
   (abbrev. 1TBS) by its partisans.  In C code, the body is typically indented
   by eight spaces (or one tab) per level, as shown here. Four spaces are
   occasionally seen in C, but in C++ and Java four tends to be the rule
   rather than the exception.</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br/>
if (&lt;cond&gt;) {<br/>
        &lt;body&gt;<br/>
}<br/>
</p></div><p><span class="firstterm">Allman style</span> &#8212; Named for
   Eric Allman, a Berkeley hacker who wrote a lot of the BSD utilities in it
   (it is sometimes called <span class="firstterm">BSD style</span>).
   Resembles normal indent style in Pascal and Algol.  It is the only style
   other than K&amp;R in widespread use among Java programmers. Basic indent
   per level shown here is eight spaces, but four (or sometimes three) spaces
   are generally preferred by C++ and Java programmers.</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br/>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)<br/>
{<br/>
        &lt;body&gt;<br/>
}<br/>
</p></div><p><span class="firstterm">Whitesmiths style</span> &#8212;
   popularized by the examples that came with Whitesmiths C, an early
   commercial C compiler.  Basic indent per level shown here is eight spaces,
   but four spaces are occasionally seen.</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br/>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)<br/>
        {<br/>
        &lt;body&gt;<br/>
        }<br/>
</p></div><p><span class="firstterm">GNU style</span> &#8212; Used
   throughout GNU EMACS and the Free Software Foundation code, and just about
   nowhere else.  Indents are always four spaces per level, with <b class="command">{</b> and <b class="command">}</b> halfway
   between the outer and inner indent levels.</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br/>
if (&lt;cond&gt;)<br/>
  {<br/>
    &lt;body&gt;<br/>
  }<br/>
</p></div><p>Surveys have shown the Allman and Whitesmiths styles to be the most
   common, with about equal mind shares.  K&amp;R/1TBS used to be nearly
   universal, but is now much less common in C (the opening brace tends to get
   lost against the right paren of the guard part in an <b class="command">if</b> or <b class="command">while</b>, which
   is a <a href="../B/Bad-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Bad Thing</i></a>).  Defenders of 1TBS argue that any
   putative gain in readability is less important than their style's relative
   economy with vertical space, which enables one to see more code on one's
   screen at once.  The Java Language Specification legislates not only the
   capitalization of identifiers, but where nouns, adjectives, and verbs
   should be in method, class, interface, and variable names (section
   6.8). While the specification stops short of also standardizing on a
   bracing style, all source code originating from Sun Laboratories uses the
   K&amp;R style.  This has set a precedent for Java programmers, which most
   follow.</p><p>Doubtless these issues will continue to be the subject of
