   Acronym</span>] A computer language designed by Don Woods and James
   Lyons in 1972.  INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer
   languages in all ways but one; it is purely a written language, being
   totally unspeakable.  An excerpt from the INTERCAL Reference Manual will
   make the style of the language clear:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is
incomprehensible is held in high esteem.  For example, if one were to state
that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable
is:</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br/>
DO :1 &lt;- #0$#256<br/>
</p></div><p>any sensible programmer would say that that was absurd.  Since this is
indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish in
front of his boss, who would of course have happened to turn up, as bosses are
wont to do.  The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer having
been correct.</p></blockquote></div><p>INTERCAL has many other peculiar features designed to make it even
   more unspeakable.  The Woods-Lyons implementation was actually used by many
   (well, at least several) people at Princeton.  The language has been
   recently reimplemented as C-INTERCAL and is consequently enjoying an
   unprecedented level of unpopularity; there is even an <tt class="systemitem">alt.lang.intercal</tt> newsgroup devoted to the
   study and ... appreciation of the language on Usenet.</p><p>Inevitably, INTERCAL has a home page on the Web: <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/" target="_top">http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/</a>. An
   extended version, implemented in (what else?)  <a href="../P/Perl.html"><i class="glossterm">Perl</i></a>
   and adding object-oriented features, is rumored to exist.  See also
   <a href="../B/Befunge.html"><i class="glossterm">Befunge</i></a>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="installfest.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../I.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="InterCaps.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">installfest </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> InterCaps</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
