First incarnated beginning in 1969 as
   the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense research testbed.  Though it has
   been widely believed that the goal was to develop a network architecture
   for military command-and-control that could survive disruptions up to and
   including nuclear war, this is a myth; in fact, ARPANET was conceived from
   the start as a way to get most economical use out of then-scarce
   large-computer resources.  Robert Herzfeld, who was director of ARPA at 
   the time, has been at some pains to debunk the 
   &#8220;<span class="quote">survive-a-nuclear-war</span>&#8221; myth, but it seems unkillable.</p><p>As originally imagined, ARPANET's major use would have been to
   support what is now called remote login and more sophisticated forms of
   distributed computing, but the infant technology of electronic mail quickly
   grew to dominate actual usage.  Universities, research labs and defense
   contractors early discovered the Internet's potential as a medium of
   communication between <span class="emphasis"><em>humans</em></span> and linked up in steadily
   increasing numbers, connecting together a quirky mix of academics, techies,
   hippies, SF fans, hackers, and anarchists.  The roots of this lexicon lie
   in those early years.</p><p>Over the next quarter-century the Internet evolved in many ways. The
   typical machine/OS combination moved from <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a>
   <a href="../P/PDP-10.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-10</i></a>s and <a href="../P/PDP-20.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-20</i></a>s, running
   <a href="../T/TOPS-10.html"><i class="glossterm">TOPS-10</i></a> and <a href="../T/TOPS-20.html"><i class="glossterm">TOPS-20</i></a>, to
   PDP-11s and <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a>en and Suns running
   <a href="../U/Unix.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix</i></a>, and in the 1990s to Unix on Intel
   microcomputers.  The Internet's protocols grew more capable, most notably
   in the move from NCP/IP to <a href="../T/TCP-IP.html"><i class="glossterm">TCP/IP</i></a> in 1982 and the
   implementation of Domain Name Service in 1983.  It was around this time
   that people began referring to the collection of interconnected networks
   with ARPANET at its core as &#8220;<span class="quote">the Internet</span>&#8221;.</p><p>The ARPANET had a fairly strict set of participation guidelines --
   connected institutions had to be involved with a DOD-related research
   project.  By the mid-80s, many of the organizations clamoring to join
   didn't fit this profile.  In 1986, the National Science Foundation built
   NSFnet to open up access to its five regional supercomputing centers;
   NSFnet became the backbone of the Internet, replacing the original ARPANET
   pipes (which were formally shut down in 1990).  Between 1990 and late 1994
   the pieces of NSFnet were sold to major telecommunications companies until
   the Internet backbone had gone completely commercial.</p><p>That year, 1994, was also the year the mainstream culture discovered
   the Internet.  Once again, the <a href="../K/killer-app.html"><i class="glossterm">killer app</i></a> was not
   the anticipated one &#8212; rather, what caught the public imagination was
   the hypertext and multimedia features of the World Wide Web.  Subsequently
   the Internet has seen off its only serious challenger (the OSI protocol
   stack favored by European telecoms monopolies) and is in the process of
   absorbing into itself many of the proprietary networks built during the
   second wave of wide-area networking after 1980.  By 1996 it had become a
   commonplace even in mainstream media to predict that a globally-extended
   Internet would become the key unifying communications technology of the
   next century.
