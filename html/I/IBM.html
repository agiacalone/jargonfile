   today, the one they are most puzzled to find themselves liking.</p><p>From hackerdom's beginnings in the mid-1960s to the early 1990s, IBM
   was regarded with active loathing.  Common expansions of the corporate name
   included: Inferior But Marketable; It's Better Manually; Insidious Black
   Magic; It's Been Malfunctioning; Incontinent Bowel Movement; and a
   near-<a href="infinite.html"><i class="glossterm">infinite</i></a> number of even less complimentary
   expansions (see also <a href="../F/fear-and-loathing.html"><i class="glossterm">fear and loathing</i></a>).  What
   galled hackers about most IBM machines above the PC level wasn't so much
   that they were underpowered and overpriced (though that counted against
   them), but that the designs were incredibly archaic,
   <a href="../C/crufty.html"><i class="glossterm">crufty</i></a>, and <a href="../E/elephantine.html"><i class="glossterm">elephantine</i></a>
   ... and you couldn't <span class="emphasis"><em>fix</em></span> them &#8212; source
   code was locked up tight, and programming tools were expensive, hard to
   find, and bletcherous to use once you had found them.</p><p>We didn't know how good we had it back then.  In the 1980s IBM had
   its own troubles with Microsoft and lost its strategic way, receding from
   the hacker community's view.  Then, in the 1990s, Microsoft became more
   noxious and omnipresent than IBM had ever been.</p><p>In the late 1990s IBM re-invented itself as a services company, began
   to release open-source software through its AlphaWorks group, and began
   shipping <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a> systems and building ties to the
   Linux community.  To the astonishment of all parties, IBM emerged as a
   staunch friend of the hacker community and 
   <a href="../O/open-source.html"><i class="glossterm">open source</i></a> development, with ironic consequences
   noted in the <a href="../F/FUD.html"><i class="glossterm">FUD</i></a> entry.</p><p>This lexicon includes a number of entries attributed to
   &#8216;IBM&#8217;; these derive from some rampantly unofficial jargon lists
   circulated within IBM's formerly beleaguered hacker underground.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="IANAL.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../I.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ICBM-address.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">IANAL </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> ICBM address</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
