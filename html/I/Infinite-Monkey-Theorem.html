   monkeys at typewriters, eventually one will bash out the script for
   Hamlet.</span>&#8221; (One may also hypothesize a small number of monkeys and a
   very long period of time.)  This theorem asserts nothing about the
   intelligence of the one <a href="../R/random.html"><i class="glossterm">random</i></a> monkey that
   eventually comes up with the script (and note that the mob will also type
   out all the possible <span class="emphasis"><em>incorrect</em></span> versions of Hamlet).
   It may be referred to semi-seriously when justifying a <a href="../B/brute-force.html"><i class="glossterm">brute
   force</i></a> method; the implication is that, with enough resources
   thrown at it, any technical challenge becomes a <a href="../O/one-banana-problem.html"><i class="glossterm">one-banana
   problem</i></a>.  This argument gets more respect since

   mode of development.</p><p>Other hackers maintain that the Infinite-Monkey Theorem cannot be
   true &#8212; otherwise Usenet would have reproduced the entire canon of
   great literature by now.</p><p>In mid-2002, researchers at Plymouth Univesity in England actually
   put a working computer in a cage with six crested macaques.  The monkeys
   proceeded to bash the machine with a rock, urinate on it, and type the
   letter S a lot (later, the letters A, J, L, and M also crept in).  The
   results were published in a limited-edition book, <i class="citetitle">Notes Towards
   The Complete Works of Shakespeare</i>. A researcher reported:
   &#8220;<span class="quote">They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when
   they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention
   there.</span>&#8221; Scattered field reports that there are AOL users this
   competent have been greeted with well-deserved skepticism.</p><p>This theorem has been traced to the mathematiciamn Émile
   Borel in 1913, and was first popularized by the astronomer Sir Arthur
   Eddington.  It became part of the idiom of techies via the classic SF short
   story <a href="http://www.janda.org/c10/readings/monkeys.htm" target="_top">Inflexible
   Logic</a> by Russell Maloney, and many younger hackers know it through
   a reference in Douglas Adams's <i class="citetitle">Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Galaxy</i>.  Some other references have been <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html" target="_top">collected
   on the Web</a>.
   On 1 April 2000 the usage acquired its own Internet standard, <a href="    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2795.txt" target="_top"> RFC2795</a> (Infinite Monkey
