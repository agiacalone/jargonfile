   commercialized the MDL parser technology used for
   <a href="../Z/Zork.html"><i class="glossterm">Zork</i></a> to produce a line of text adventure games that
   remain favorites among hackers.  Infocom's games were intelligent, funny,
   witty, erudite, irreverent, challenging, satirical, and most thoroughly
   hackish in spirit.  The physical game packages from Infocom are now prized
   collector's items.  After being acquired by Activision in 1989 they did a
   few more &#8220;<span class="quote">modern</span>&#8221; (e.g. graphics-intensive) games which were
   less successful than reissues of their classics.</p><p>The software, thankfully, is still extant; Infocom games were written
   in a kind of P-code (called, actually, <span class="firstterm">z-code</span>) and distributed with a P-code
   interpreter core, and not only open-source emulators for that interpreter
   but an actual compiler as well have been written to permit the P-code to be
   run on platforms the games never originally graced. In fact, new games
   written in this P-code are still being written.  There is a home page at
   <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/" target="_top">http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/</a>,
   and it is even possible to play these games in your <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~pot/infocom/" target="_top">browser</a> if it is
   Java-capable.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="inflate.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../I.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="initgame.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">inflate </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> initgame</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
