The <a href="../P/PDP-10.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-10</i></a> successor that was to have been
   built by the Super Foonly project at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
   Laboratory along with a new operating system.  (The name itself came from
   FOO NLI, an error message emitted by a PDP-10 assembler at SAIL meaning
   &#8220;<span class="quote">FOO is Not a Legal Identifier</span>&#8221;.  The intention was to
   leapfrog from the old <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a> timesharing system SAIL
   was then running to a new generation, bypassing TENEX which at that time
   was the ARPANET standard.  ARPA funding for both the Super Foonly and the
   new operating system was cut in 1974.  Most of the design team went to DEC
   and contributed greatly to the design of the PDP-10 model KL10.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. The name of the company formed by Dave Poole, one of the
   principal Super Foonly designers, and one of hackerdom's more colorful
   personalities.  Many people remember the parrot which sat on Poole's
   shoulder and was a regular companion.</p></dd><dd><p> 3. Any of the machines built by Poole's company.  The first was the
   F-1 (a.k.a.  Super Foonly), which was the computational engine used to
   create the graphics in the movie <i class="citetitle">TRON</i>.  The F-1 was
   the fastest PDP-10 ever built, but only one was ever made.  The effort
   drained Foonly of its financial resources, and the company turned towards
   building smaller, slower, and much less expensive machines.  Unfortunately,
   these ran not the popular <a href="../T/TOPS-20.html"><i class="glossterm">TOPS-20</i></a> but a TENEX
   variant called Foonex; this seriously limited their market.  Also, the
   machines shipped were actually wire-wrapped engineering prototypes
   requiring individual attention from more than usually competent site
   personnel, and thus had significant reliability problems.  Poole's
   legendary temper and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly did not help
   matters.  By the time DEC's &#8220;<span class="quote">Jupiter Project</span>&#8221; followon to the
   PDP-10 was cancelled in 1983, Foonly's proposal to build another F-1 was
   eclipsed by the <a href="../M/Mars.html"><i class="glossterm">Mars</i></a>, and the company never quite
   recovered.  See the <a href="../M/Mars.html"><i class="glossterm">Mars</i></a> entry for the continuation
   and moral of this story.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="fool-file.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="footprint.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">fool file </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> footprint</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
