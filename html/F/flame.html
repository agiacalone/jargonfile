   When a discussion degenerates into useless controversy, one might tell the
   participants &#8220;<span class="quote">Now you're just flaming</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">Stop all that
   flamage!</span>&#8221; to try to get them to cool down (so to speak).</p></dd><dd><p>The term may have been independently invented at several different
   places.  It has been reported from MIT, Carleton College and RPI (among
   many other places) from as far back as 1969, and from the University of
   Virginia in the early 1960s.</p><p>It is possible that the hackish sense of &#8216;flame&#8217; is much
   older than that.  The poet Chaucer was also what passed for a wizard hacker
   in his time; he wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, the most advanced
   computing device of the day.  In Chaucer's <i class="citetitle">Troilus and
   Cressida</i>, Cressida laments her inability to grasp the proof of
   a particular mathematical theorem; her uncle Pandarus then observes that
   it's called &#8220;<span class="quote">the fleminge of wrecches.</span>&#8221; This phrase seems to
   have been intended in context as &#8220;<span class="quote">that which puts the wretches to
   flight</span>&#8221; but was probably just as ambiguous in Middle English as
   &#8220;<span class="quote">the flaming of wretches</span>&#8221; would be today.  One suspects that
   Chaucer would feel right at home on Usenet.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="flamage.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="flame-bait.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">flamage </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> flame bait</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
