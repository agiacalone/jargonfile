   &#8220;<span class="quote">FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people
   instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering
   [Amdahl] products.</span>&#8221; The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go
   with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment.  This implicit
   coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would
   happen to people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the
   future of competitors' equipment or software.  See
   <a href="../I/IBM.html"><i class="glossterm">IBM</i></a>.  After 1990 the term FUD was associated
   increasingly frequently with <a href="../M/Microsoft.html"><i class="glossterm">Microsoft</i></a>, and has
   become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a
   competitive weapon.</p></dd><dd><p>[In 2003, SCO sued IBM in an action which, among other things,
   alleged SCO's proprietary control of <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a>.  The SCO
   suit rapidly became infamous for the number and magnitude of falsehoods
   alleged in SCO's filings.  In October 2003, SCO's lawyers filed a <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031024191141102" target="_top">memorandum</a>
   in which they actually had the temerity to link to the web version of
   <span class="emphasis"><em>this entry</em></span> in furtherance of their claims. Whilst we
   appreciate the compliment of being treated as an authority, we can return
   it only by observing that SCO has become a nest of liars and thieves
   compared to which IBM at its historic worst looked positively
   angelic. Any judge or law clerk reading this should surf through to
   <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/sco.html" target="_top">my collected resources</a> on this
   topic for the appalling details.&#8212;ESR]</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="fuck-me-harder.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="FUD-wars.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">fuck me harder </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> FUD wars</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
