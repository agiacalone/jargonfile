   Whether it is good or not is immaterial (but if bad, it is also a
   <a href="../M/misfeature.html"><i class="glossterm">misfeature</i></a>).  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. A surprising property or behavior; in particular, one that is
   purposely inconsistent because it works better that way &#8212; such an
   inconsistency is therefore a <a href="feature.html"><i class="glossterm">feature</i></a> and not a
   <a href="../B/bug.html"><i class="glossterm">bug</i></a>.  This kind of feature is sometimes called a
   <a href="../M/miswart.html"><i class="glossterm">miswart</i></a>; see that entry for a classic example.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 4. A property or behavior that is gratuitous or unnecessary, though
   perhaps also impressive or cute.  For example, one feature of Common LISP's
   <b class="command">format</b> function is the ability to print
   numbers in two different Roman-numeral formats (see 
   <a href="../B/bells-whistles-and-gongs.html"><i class="glossterm">bells whistles and gongs</i></a>).  </p></dd><dd><p> 5. A property or behavior that was put in to help someone else but
   that happens to be in your way.  </p></dd><dd><p> 6. [common] A bug that has been documented.  To call something a
   feature sometimes means the author of the program did not consider the
   particular case, and that the program responded in a way that was
   unexpected but not strictly incorrect.  A standard joke is that a bug can
   be turned into a <a href="feature.html"><i class="glossterm">feature</i></a> simply by documenting it
   (then theoretically no one can complain about it because it's in the
   manual), or even by simply declaring it to be good.  &#8220;<span class="quote">That's not a
   bug, that's a feature!</span>&#8221; is a common catchphrase.  See also

   miswarts might be clarified by the following hypothetical exchange between
   two hackers on an airliner:</p><p>A: &#8220;<span class="quote">This seat doesn't recline.</span>&#8221;</p><p>B: &#8220;<span class="quote">That's not a bug, that's a feature.  There is an emergency
   exit door built around the window behind you, and the route has to be kept
   clear.</span>&#8221;</p><p>A: &#8220;<span class="quote">Oh.  Then it's a misfeature; they should have increased the
   spacing between rows here.</span>&#8221;</p><p>B: &#8220;<span class="quote">Yes.  But if they'd increased spacing in only one section
   it would have been a wart &#8212; they would've had to make
   nonstandard-length ceiling panels to fit over the displaced
   seats.</span>&#8221;</p><p>A: &#8220;<span class="quote">A miswart, actually.  If they increased spacing throughout
   they'd lose several rows and a chunk out of the profit margin.  So unequal
   spacing would actually be the Right Thing.</span>&#8221;</p><p>B: &#8220;<span class="quote">Indeed.</span>&#8221;</p><p><span class="firstterm">Undocumented feature</span> is a
