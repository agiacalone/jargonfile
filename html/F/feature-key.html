   keytop; sometimes referred to as <span class="firstterm">flower</span>, <span class="firstterm">pretzel</span>, <span class="firstterm">clover</span>, <span class="firstterm">propeller</span>, <span class="firstterm">beanie</span> (an apparent reference to the major
   feature of a propeller beanie), <a href="../S/splat.html"><i class="glossterm">splat</i></a>, <span class="firstterm">open-apple</span> or (officially, in Mac
   documentation) the <span class="firstterm">command key</span>. In
   French, the term <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">papillon</i></span> (butterfly) has
   been reported. The proliferation of terms for this creature may illustrate
   one subtle peril of iconic interfaces.</p><p>Many people have been mystified by the cloverleaf-like symbol that
   appears on the feature key.  Its oldest name is &#8216;cross of St.
   Hannes&#8217;, but it occurs in pre-Christian Viking art as a decorative
   motif.  Throughout Scandinavia today the road agencies use it to mark sites
   of historical interest.  Apple picked up the symbol from an early Mac
   developer who happened to be Swedish.  Apple documentation gives the
   translation &#8220;<span class="quote">interesting feature</span>&#8221;!</p><p>There is some dispute as to the proper (Swedish) name of this symbol.
   It technically stands for the word
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">sevärdhet</i></span> (thing worth seeing); many of
   these are old churches. Some Swedes report as an idiom for the sign the
   word <span class="firstterm">kyrka</span>, cognate to English
   &#8216;church&#8217; and pronounced (roughly) <span class="pronunciation">/chur´ka/</span> in modern Swedish.  Others
   say this is nonsense.  Other idioms reported for the sign are
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">runa</i></span> (rune) or <span class="firstterm">runsten</span> <span class="pronunciation">/roon´stn/</span> (runestone), derived from
   the fact that many of the interesting features are Viking rune-stones.  The
   term <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">fornminne</i></span> <span class="pronunciation">/foorn´min'@/</span> (relic of
   antiquity, ancient monument) is also reported, especially among those who
   think that the Mac itself is a relic of antiquity.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="feature-creep.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="feature-shock.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">feature creep </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> feature shock</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
