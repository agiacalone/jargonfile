   it has generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang acronym
   <a href="FUBAR.html"><i class="glossterm">FUBAR</i></a> (&#8216;Fucked Up Beyond All Repair&#8217; or
   &#8216;Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition&#8217;), later modified to
   <a href="foobar.html"><i class="glossterm">foobar</i></a>.  Early versions of the Jargon File
   interpreted this change as a post-war bowdlerization, but it it now seems
   more likely that FUBAR was itself a derivative of &#8216;foo&#8217; perhaps
   influenced by German <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">furchtbar</i></span> (terrible)
   &#8212; &#8216;foobar&#8217; may actually have been the
   <span class="emphasis"><em>original</em></span> form.</p><p>For, it seems, the word &#8216;foo&#8217; itself had an immediate
   prewar history in comic strips and cartoons.  The earliest documented uses
   were in the <i class="citetitle">Smokey Stover</i> comic strip published from
   about 1930 to about 1952.  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled it
   with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other nonsense phrases
   such as &#8220;<span class="quote">Notary Sojac</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="quote">1506 nix nix</span>&#8221;.  The
   word &#8220;<span class="quote">foo</span>&#8221; frequently appeared on license plates of cars, in
   nonsense sayings in the background of some frames (such as &#8220;<span class="quote">He who
   foos last foos best</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">Many smoke but foo men chew</span>&#8221;),
   and Holman had Smokey say &#8220;<span class="quote">Where there's foo, there's
   fire</span>&#8221;.</p><p>According to the <a href="http://members.aol.com/EOCostello/" target="_top">
   Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion</a> Holman claimed to have found the
   word &#8220;<span class="quote">foo</span>&#8221; on the bottom of a Chinese figurine.  This is
   plausible; Chinese statuettes often have apotropaic inscriptions, and this
   one was almost certainly the Mandarin Chinese word
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">fu</i></span> (sometimes transliterated
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">foo</i></span>), which can mean
   &#8220;<span class="quote">happiness</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">prosperity</span>&#8221; when spoken with the
   rising tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking the steps of many Chinese
   restaurants are properly called &#8220;<span class="quote">fu dogs</span>&#8221;).  English speakers'
   reception of Holman's &#8216;foo&#8217; nonsense word was undoubtedly
   influenced by Yiddish &#8216;feh&#8217; and English &#8216;fooey&#8217; and
   &#8216;fool&#8217;.</p><p>Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode on
   two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the late 1930s,
   and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even produced an operable
   version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to the Encyclopedia of American
   Comics, &#8216;Foo&#8217; fever swept the U.S., finding its way into
   popular songs and generating over 500 &#8216;Foo Clubs.&#8217; The fad left
   &#8216;foo&#8217; references embedded in popular culture (including a
   couple of appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons of 1938-39; notably in
   Robert Clampett's &#8220;<span class="quote">Daffy Doc</span>&#8221; of 1938, in which a very early
   version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying &#8220;<span class="quote">SILENCE IS
   FOO!</span>&#8221;) When the fad faded, the origin of &#8220;<span class="quote">foo</span>&#8221; was
   forgotten.</p><p>One place &#8220;<span class="quote">foo</span>&#8221; is known to have remained live is in the
   U.S. military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term &#8216;foo
   fighters&#8217; was in use by radar operators for the kind of mysterious or
   spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the older term resurfaced
   in popular American usage in 1995 via the name of one of the better
   grunge-rock bands).  Because informants connected the term directly to the
   Smokey Stover strip, the folk etymology that connects it to French
   &#8220;<span class="quote">feu</span>&#8221; (fire) can be gently dismissed.</p><p>The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms during
   the war (see <a href="../K/kluge.html"><i class="glossterm">kluge</i></a> and <a href="../K/kludge.html"><i class="glossterm">kludge</i></a>
   for another important example) Period sources reported that
   &#8216;FOO&#8217; became a semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army
   graffiti more or less equivalent to the American Kilroy.  Where British
   troops went, the graffito &#8220;<span class="quote">FOO was here</span>&#8221; or something similar
   showed up.  Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from
   Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous
   &#8220;<span class="quote">FUBAR</span>&#8221;) was probably a <a href="../B/backronym.html"><i class="glossterm">backronym</i></a> .
   Forty years later, Paul Dickson's excellent book &#8220;<span class="quote">Words</span>&#8221;
   (Dell, 1982, ISBN 0-440-52260-7) traced &#8220;<span class="quote">Foo</span>&#8221; to an
   unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter
   omniscience and sarcasm.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Earlier versions of this entry suggested the possibility that hacker
   usage actually sprang from <i class="citetitle">FOO, Lampoons and Parody</i>,
   the title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint project
   of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in his mid-teens)
   later became one of the most important and influential artists in
   underground comics, this venture was hardly a success; indeed, the brothers
   later burned most of the existing copies in disgust.  The title FOO was
   featured in large letters on the front cover.  However, very few copies of
   this comic actually circulated, and students of Crumb's
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">oeuvre</i></span> have established that this title was
   a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.  The Crumbs may also have
   been influenced by a short-lived Canadian parody magazine named
   &#8216;Foo&#8217; published in 1951-52.</p><p>An old-time member reports that in the 1959 <i class="citetitle">Dictionary of
   the TMRC Language</i>, compiled at <a href="../T/TMRC.html"><i class="glossterm">TMRC</i></a>,
   there was an entry that went something like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
FOO: The first syllable of the sacred chant phrase &#8220;<span class="quote">FOO MANE PADME
HUM.</span>&#8221; Our first obligation is to keep the foo counters turning.
</p></blockquote></div><p>(For more about the legendary foo counters, see
   <a href="../T/TMRC.html"><i class="glossterm">TMRC</i></a>.)  This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense
   word, then only two decades old and demonstrably still live in popular
   culture and slang, to a <a href="../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html"><i class="glossterm">ha ha only serious</i></a> analogy
   with esoteric Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to
   resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's were any
   less susceptible. Almost the entire staff of what later became the MIT AI
   Lab was involved with TMRC, and the word spread from there.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="fontology.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="foobar.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">fontology </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> foobar</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
