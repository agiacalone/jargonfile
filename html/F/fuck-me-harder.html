   software, and esp. of misbehaviors which seem unfairly persistent (as
   though designed in by the imp of the perverse).  Often theatrically
   elaborated: &#8220;<span class="quote">Aiighhh! Fuck me with a piledriver and 16 feet of
   curare-tipped wrought-iron fence <span class="emphasis"><em>and no
   lubricants</em></span>!</span>&#8221; The phrase is sometimes heard abbreviated
   <span class="firstterm">FMH</span> in polite company.</p><p>[This entry is an extreme example of the hackish habit of coining
   elaborate and evocative terms for lossage. Here we see a quite
   self-conscious parody of mainstream expletives that has become a running
   gag in part of the hacker culture; it illustrates the hackish tendency to
   turn any situation, even one of extreme frustration, into an intellectual
   game (the point being, in this case, to creatively produce a long-winded
   description of the most anatomically absurd mental image possible &#8212;
   the short forms implicitly allude to all the ridiculous long forms ever
   spoken).  Scatological language is actually relatively uncommon among
   hackers, and there was some controversy over whether this entry ought to be
   included at all.  As it reflects a live usage recognizably peculiar to the
   hacker culture, we feel it is in the hackish spirit of truthfulness and
   opposition to all forms of censorship to record it here. &#8212;ESR &amp;
