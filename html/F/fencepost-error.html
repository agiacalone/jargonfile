[common] A problem with the discrete equivalent of a boundary
   condition, often exhibited in programs by iterative loops.  From the
   following problem: &#8220;<span class="quote">If you build a fence 100 feet long with posts 10
   feet apart, how many posts do you need?</span>&#8221; (Either 9 or 11 is a better
   answer than the obvious 10.)  For example, suppose you have a long list or
   array of items, and want to process items
   <tt class="literal">m</tt> through
   <tt class="literal">n</tt>; how many items are there?  The obvious
   answer is <tt class="literal">n - m</tt>, but that is off by one;
   the right answer is <tt class="literal">n - m + 1</tt>.  A program
   that used the &#8216;obvious&#8217; formula would have a fencepost error in
   it.  See also <a href="../Z/zeroth.html"><i class="glossterm">zeroth</i></a> and 
   <a href="../O/off-by-one-error.html"><i class="glossterm">off-by-one error</i></a>, and note that not all off-by-one errors are fencepost
   errors.  The game of Musical Chairs involves a catastrophic off-by-one
   error where <tt class="literal">N</tt> people try to sit in
   <tt class="literal">N - 1</tt> chairs, but it's not a fencepost
   error.  Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces
   between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one
   should count one or both ends of a row.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. [rare] An error induced by unexpected regularities in input
   values, which can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically
   efficient binary tree or hash table implementation.  (The error here
   involves the difference between expected and worst case behaviors of an
   algorithm.)</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="fence.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../F.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="fiber-seeking-backhoe.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">fence </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> fiber-seeking backhoe</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
