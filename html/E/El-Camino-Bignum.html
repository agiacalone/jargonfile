   Francisco peninsula.  It originally extended all the way down to Mexico
   City; many portions of the old road are still intact.  Navigation on the
   San Francisco peninsula is usually done relative to El Camino Real, which
   defines <a href="../L/logical.html"><i class="glossterm">logical</i></a> north and south even though it isn't
   really north-south in many places.  El Camino Real runs right past Stanford
   University and so is familiar to hackers.</p><p>The Spanish word &#8216;real&#8217; (which has two syllables:
   <span class="pronunciation">/ray·ahl´/</span>) means
   &#8216;royal&#8217;; El Camino Real is &#8216;the royal road&#8217;.  In
   the FORTRAN language, a <span class="firstterm">real</span> quantity
   is a number typically precise to seven significant digits, and a <span class="firstterm">double precision</span> quantity is a larger
   floating-point number, precise to perhaps fourteen significant digits
   (other languages have similar <span class="firstterm">real</span>
   types).</p><p>When a hacker from MIT visited Stanford in 1976, he remarked what a
   long road El Camino Real was.  Making a pun on &#8216;real&#8217;, he
   started calling it &#8216;El Camino Double Precision&#8217; &#8212; but
   when the hacker was told that the road was hundreds of miles long, he
   renamed it &#8216;El Camino Bignum&#8217;, and that name has stuck.  (See
   <a href="../B/bignum.html"><i class="glossterm">bignum</i></a>.)</p><p>[GLS has since let slip that the unnamed hacker in this story was in
   fact himself &#8212;ESR]</p><p>In the early 1990s, the synonym <span class="firstterm">El Camino
   Virtual</span> was been reported as an alternate at IBM and Amdahl
   sites in the Valley.</p><p>Mathematically literate hackers in the Valley have also been heard
   to refer to some major cross-street intersecting El Camino Real as
   &#8220;<span class="quote">El Camino Imaginary</span>&#8221;.  One popular theory is that the
   intersection is located near Moffett Field &#8212; where they keep all
   those complex planes.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="eighty-column-mind.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../E.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="elder-days.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">eighty-column mind </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> elder days</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
