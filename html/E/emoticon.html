   or news.  Although originally intended mostly as jokes, emoticons (or some
   other explicit humor indication) are virtually required under certain
   circumstances in high-volume text-only communication forums such as Usenet;
   the lack of verbal and visual cues can otherwise cause what were intended
   to be humorous, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise non-100%-serious comments
   to be badly misinterpreted (not always even by
   <a href="../N/newbie.html"><i class="glossterm">newbie</i></a>s), resulting in arguments and
   <a href="../F/flame-war.html"><i class="glossterm">flame war</i></a>s.</p><p>Hundreds of emoticons have been proposed, but only a few are in
   common use.  These include: </p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>:-)</td><td>&#8216;smiley face&#8217; (for humor,
   laughter, friendliness, occasionally sarcasm)</td></tr><tr><td>:-(</td><td>&#8216;frowney face&#8217; (for sadness,
   anger, or upset)</td></tr><tr><td>;-)</td><td>&#8216;half-smiley&#8217; (
   <a href="../H/ha-ha-only-serious.html"><i class="glossterm">ha ha only serious</i></a>); also known as <span class="firstterm">semi-smiley</span> or <span class="firstterm">winkey face</span>.</td></tr><tr><td>:-/</td><td>&#8216;wry face&#8217;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p> (These may become more comprehensible if you
   tilt your head sideways, to the left.)  The first two listed are by far the
   most frequently encountered.  Hyphenless forms of them are common on
   CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX; see also <a href="../B/bixie.html"><i class="glossterm">bixie</i></a>.  On
   <a href="../U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a>, <span class="firstterm">smiley</span>
   is often used as a generic term synonymous with
   <a href="emoticon.html"><i class="glossterm">emoticon</i></a>, as well as specifically for the happy-face
   emoticon.</p></dd><dd><p>The invention of the original smiley and frowney emoticons is
   generally credited to Scott Fahlman at CMU in 1982. He later wrote:
   &#8220;<span class="quote">I wish I had saved the original post, or at least recorded the date
   for posterity, but I had no idea that I was starting something that would
   soon pollute all the world's communication channels.</span>&#8221; In September
   2002 the original post <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~mbj/Smiley/Smiley.html" target="_top"> was
   recovered</a>.</p><p>There is a rival claim by one Kevin McKenzie, who seems to have
   proposed the smiley on the MsgGroup mailing list, April 12 1979.  It seems
   likely these two inventions were independent.  Users of the PLATO
   educational system <a href=" http://www.platopeople.com/emoticons.html" target="_top">
   report</a> using emoticons composed from overlaid dot-matrix graphics
   in the 1970s.</p><p>Note for the <a href="../N/newbie.html"><i class="glossterm">newbie</i></a>: Overuse of the smiley is
   a mark of loserhood!  More than one per paragraph is a fairly sure sign
   that you've gone over the line.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="email.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../E.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="EMP.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">email </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> EMP</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
