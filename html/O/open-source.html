   following the Mozilla release to describe software distributed in source
   under licenses guaranteeing anybody rights to freely use, modify, and
   redistribute, the code.  The intent was to be able to sell the hackers'
   ways of doing software to industry and the mainstream by avoiding the
   negative connotations (to <a href="../S/suit.html"><i class="glossterm">suit</i></a>s) of the term
   &#8220;<span class="quote"><a href="../F/free-software.html"><i class="glossterm">free software</i></a></span>&#8221;.  For discussion of the
   follow-on tactics and their consequences, see the <a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source Initiative</a>
   site.</p></dd><dd><p>Five years after this term was invented, in 2003, it is worth noting
   the huge shift in assumptions it helped bring about, if only because the
   hacker culture's collective memory of what went before is in some ways
   blurring. Hackers have so completely refocused themselves around the idea
   and ideal of open source that we are beginning to forget that we used to do
   most of our work in closed-source environments.  Until the late 1990s open
   source was a sporadic exception that usually had to live on top of a
   closed-source operating system and alongside closed-source tools; entire
   open-source environments like <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a> and the *BSD
   systems didn't even exist in a usable form until around 1993 and weren't
   taken very seriously by anyone but a pioneering few until about five years
   later. </p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="open.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../O.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="open-switch.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">open </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> open switch</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
