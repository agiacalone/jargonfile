In the multi-player space combat game Netrek, to execute kamikaze
   attacks against enemy ships which are carrying armies or occupying
   strategic positions.  Named during a game in which one of the players
   repeatedly used the tactic while playing Orion ship G, showing up in the
   player list as &#8220;<span class="quote">Og</span>&#8221;.  This trick has been roundly denounced by
   those who would return to the good old days when the tactic of dogfighting
   was dominant, but as Sun Tzu wrote, &#8220;<span class="quote">What is of supreme importance in
   war is to attack the enemy's strategy, not his tactics.</span>&#8221; However,
   the traditional answer to the newbie question &#8220;<span class="quote">What does ogg
   mean?</span>&#8221; is just &#8220;<span class="quote">Pick up some armies and I'll show you.</span>&#8221;
   </p></dd><dd><p> 2. In other games, to forcefully attack an opponent with the
   expectation that the resources expended will be renewed faster than the
   opponent will be able to regain his previous advantage.  Taken more
   seriously as a tactic since it has gained a simple name.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. To do anything forcefully, possibly without consideration of the
   drain on future resources.  &#8220;<span class="quote">I guess I'd better go ogg the problem
   set that's due tomorrow.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Whoops!  I looked down at the map
   for a sec and almost ogged that oncoming car.</span>&#8221;</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="offline.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../O.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="suffix-oid.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">offline </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> -oid</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
