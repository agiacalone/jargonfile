   letter of the English alphabet).  In their unmodified forms they look a lot
   alike, and various kluges invented to make them visually distinct have
   compounded the confusion.  If your zero is center-dotted and letter-O is
   not, or if letter-O looks almost rectangular but zero looks more like an
   American football stood on end (or the reverse), you're probably looking at
   a modern character display (though the dotted zero seems to have originated
   as an option on IBM 3270 controllers).  If your zero is slashed but
   letter-O is not, you're probably looking at an old-style ASCII graphic set
   descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype
   (Scandinavians, for whom Ø is a letter, curse this arrangement).
   (Interestingly, the slashed zero long predates computers; Florian Cajori's
   monumental <i class="citetitle">A History of Mathematical Notations</i> notes
   that it was used in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.) If letter-O has
   a slash across it and the zero does not, your display is tuned for a very
   old convention used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers
   (Scandinavians curse <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> arrangement even more,
   because it means two of their letters collide).  Some Burroughs/Unisys
   equipment displays a zero with a <span class="emphasis"><em>reversed</em></span> slash. Old
   CDC computers rendered letter O as an unbroken oval and 0 as an oval broken
   at upper right and lower left.  And yet another convention common on early
   line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the
   letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O
   (this was endorsed by a draft ANSI standard for how to draw ASCII
   characters, but the final standard changed the distinguisher to a tick-mark
   in the upper-left corner).  Are we sufficiently confused yet?</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="me.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../0.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="one-TBS.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">/me </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 1TBS</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
