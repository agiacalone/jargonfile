other people.  This may be because hackers generally aren't much like
‘other people’.  Unsurprisingly, hackers also tend towards
self-absorption, intellectual arrogance, and impatience with people and tasks
perceived to be wasting their time.</p><p>As cynical as hackers sometimes wax about the amount of idiocy in the
world, they tend by reflex to assume that everyone is as rational,
‘cool’, and imaginative as they consider themselves.  This bias
often contributes to weakness in communication skills.  Hackers tend to be
especially poor at confrontation and negotiation.  </p><p>Another weakness of the hacker personality is a perverse tendancy to
attack all problems from the most technically complicated angle, just because
it may mean more interesting problems to solve, or cooler toys to play with.
Hackers sometimes have trouble grokking that the bubble gum and paperclip
hardware fix is actually the way to go, and that they really don't need to
convince the client to buy that shiny new tool they've had your eye on for two
months.</p><p>Because of their passionate embrace of (what they consider to be) the
<a href="R/Right-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Right Thing</i></a>, hackers can be unfortunately intolerant
and bigoted on technical issues, in marked contrast to their general spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance of alternative viewpoints otherwise.  Old-time
<a href="I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a> partisans look down on the ever-growing hordes of
<a href="U/Unix.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix</i></a> and <a href="L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a> hackers; Unix
aficionados despise <a href="V/VMS.html"><i class="glossterm">VMS</i></a> and Windows; and hackers who
are used to conventional command-line user interfaces loudly loathe
mouse-and-menu based systems such as the Macintosh.  Hackers who don't indulge
in <a href="U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a> consider it a huge waste of time and
<a href="B/bandwidth.html"><i class="glossterm">bandwidth</i></a>; fans of old adventure games such as
<a href="A/ADVENT.html"><i class="glossterm">ADVENT</i></a> and <a href="Z/Zork.html"><i class="glossterm">Zork</i></a> consider
<a href="M/MUD.html"><i class="glossterm">MUD</i></a>s to be glorified chat systems devoid of atmosphere
or interesting puzzles; hackers who are willing to devote endless hours to
Usenet or MUDs consider <a href="I/IRC.html"><i class="glossterm">IRC</i></a> to be a
<span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> waste of time; IRCies think MUDs might be okay if
there weren't all those silly puzzles in the way.  And, of course, there are
the perennial <a href="H/holy-wars.html"><i class="glossterm">holy wars</i></a> —
<a href="E/EMACS.html"><i class="glossterm">EMACS</i></a> vs. <a href="V/vi.html"><i class="glossterm">vi</i></a>,
<a href="B/big-endian.html"><i class="glossterm">big-endian</i></a> vs.  <a href="L/little-endian.html"><i class="glossterm">little-endian</i></a>,
RISC vs. CISC, etc., etc., etc.  As in society at large, the intensity and
duration of these debates is usually inversely proportional to the number of
objective, factual arguments available to buttress any position.</p><p>As a result of all the above traits, many hackers have difficulty
maintaining stable relationships.  At worst, they can produce the classic
<a href="G/geek.html"><i class="glossterm">geek</i></a>: withdrawn, relationally incompetent, sexually
frustrated, and desperately unhappy when not submerged in his or her craft.
Fortunately, this extreme is far less common than mainstream folklore paints
it — but almost all hackers will recognize something of themselves in
the unflattering paragraphs above.</p><p>Hackers are often monumentally disorganized and sloppy about dealing
with the physical world.  Bills don't get paid on time, clutter piles up to
incredible heights in homes and offices, and minor maintenance tasks get
deferred indefinitely.</p><p>1994-95's fad behavioral disease was a syndrome called Attention Deficit
Disorder (ADD), supposedly characterized by (among other things) a combination
of short attention span with an ability to ‘hyperfocus’
imaginatively on interesting tasks.  In 1998-1999 another syndrome that is
said to overlap with many hacker traits entered popular awareness: Asperger's
syndrome (AS).  This disorder is also sometimes called ‘high-function
autism’, though researchers are divided on whether AS is in fact a mild
form of autism or a distinct syndrome with a different etiology.  AS patients
exhibit mild to severe deficits in interpreting facial and body-language cues
and in modeling or empathizing with others' emotions.  Though some AS patients
exhibit mild retardation, others compensate for their deficits with high
intelligence and analytical ability, and frequently seek out technical fields
where problem-solving abilities are at a premium and people skills are
relatively unimportant.  Both syndromes are thought to relate to abnormalities
in neurotransmitter chemistry, especially the brain's processing of
serotonin.</p><p>Many hackers have noticed that mainstream culture has shown a tendency
to pathologize and medicalize normal variations in personality, especially
those variations that make life more complicated for authority figures and
conformists. Thus, hackers aware of the issue tend to be among those
questioning whether ADD and AS actually exist; and if so whether they are
really ‘diseases’ rather than extremes of a normal genetic
variation like having freckles or being able to taste DPT.  In either case,
they have a sneaking tendency to wonder if these syndromes are over-diagnosed
and over-treated.  After all, people in authority will always be
inconvenienced by schoolchildren or workers or citizens who are prickly,
intelligent individualists — thus, any social system that depends on
authority relationships will tend to helpfully ostracize and therapize and
drug such ‘abnormal’ people until they are properly docile and
stupid and ‘well-socialized’.</p><p>So hackers tend to believe they have good reason for skepticism about
clinical explanations of the hacker personality.  That being said, most would
also concede that some hacker traits coincide with indicators for
non-hyperactive ADD and AS — the status of caffeine as a hacker beverage of
choice may be connected to the fact that it bonds to the same neural receptors
as Ritalin, the drug most commonly prescribed for ADD.  It is probably true
that boosters of both would find a rather higher rate of clinical ADD among
hackers than the supposedly mainstream-normal 3-5% (AS is rarer at
0.4-0.5%).</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="personality.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="appendixb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="miscellaneous.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Personality Characteristics </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Miscellaneous</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
