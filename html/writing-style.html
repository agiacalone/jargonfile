grammatical rules.  This is one aspect of a more general fondness for
form-versus-content language jokes that shows up particularly in hackish
writing.  One correspondent reports that he consistently misspells
‘wrong’ as ‘worng’.  Others have been known to
criticize glitches in Jargon File drafts by observing (in the mode of Douglas
Hofstadter) “<span class="quote">This sentence no verb</span>”, or “<span class="quote">Too
repetetetive</span>”, or “<span class="quote">Bad speling</span>”, or “<span class="quote">Incorrectspa
cing.</span>” Similarly, intentional spoonerisms are often made of phrases
relating to confusion or things that are confusing; ‘dain bramage’
for ‘brain damage’ is perhaps the most common (similarly, a hacker
would be likely to write “<span class="quote">Excuse me, I'm cixelsyd today</span>”, rather
than “<span class="quote">I'm dyslexic today</span>”).  This sort of thing is quite common
and is enjoyed by all concerned.</p><p>Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much
to the dismay of American editors.  Thus, if “<span class="quote">Jim is going</span>” is a
phrase, and so are “<span class="quote">Bill runs</span>” and “<span class="quote">Spock groks</span>”,
then hackers generally prefer to write: “<span class="quote">Jim is going</span>”,
“<span class="quote">Bill runs</span>”, and “<span class="quote">Spock groks</span>”.  This is incorrect
according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation commas
and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is
counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters that
don't belong in them.  Given the sorts of examples that can come up in
discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be grossly
misleading.  When communicating command lines or small pieces of code, extra
characters can be a real pain in the neck.</p><p>Consider, for example, a sentence in a <a href="V/vi.html"><i class="glossterm">vi</i></a>
tutorial that looks like this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Then delete a line from the file by typing “<span class="quote">dd</span>”.</p></blockquote></div><p>Standard usage would make this</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Then delete a line from the file by typing “<span class="quote">dd.</span>”</p></blockquote></div><p>but that would be very bad — because the reader would be prone to
type the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">vi</span>(1)</span>,
dot repeats the last command accepted.  The net result would be to delete
<span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> lines!</p><p>The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout.</p><p>Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great
Britain, though the older style (which became established for typographical
reasons having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text)
is still accepted there.  <i class="citetitle">Hart's Rules</i> and the
<i class="citetitle">Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors</i> call the
hacker-like style ‘new’ or ‘logical’ quoting.  This
returns British English to the style many other languages (including Spanish,
French, Italian, Catalan, and German) have been using all along.</p><p>Another hacker habit is a tendency to distinguish between
‘scare’ quotes and ‘speech’ quotes; that is, to use
British-style single quotes for marking and reserve American-style double
quotes for actual reports of speech or text included from elsewhere.
Interestingly, some authorities describe this as correct general usage, but
mainstream American English has gone to using double-quotes indiscriminately
enough that hacker usage appears marked [and, in fact, I thought this was a
personal quirk of mine until I checked with Usenet —ESR] One further
permutation that is definitely <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> standard is a hackish
tendency to do marking quotes by using apostrophes (single quotes) in pairs;
that is, ’like this’.  This is modelled on string and character
literal syntax in some programming languages (reinforced by the fact that many
character-only terminals display the apostrophe in typewriter style, as a
vertical single quote).</p><p>One quirk that shows up frequently in the <a href="E/email.html"><i class="glossterm">email</i></a>
style of Unix hackers in particular is a tendency for some things that are
normally all-lowercase (including usernames and the names of commands and C
routines) to remain uncapitalized even when they occur at the beginning of
sentences.  It is clear that, for many hackers, the case of such identifiers
becomes a part of their internal representation (the ‘spelling’)
and cannot be overridden without mental effort (an appropriate reflex because
Unix and C both distinguish cases and confusing them can lead to
<a href="L/lossage.html"><i class="glossterm">lossage</i></a>).  A way of escaping this dilemma is simply to
avoid using these constructions at the beginning of sentences.</p><p>There seems to be a meta-rule behind these nonstandard hackerisms to the
effect that precision of expression is more important than conformance to
traditional rules; where the latter create ambiguity or lose information they
can be discarded without a second thought.  It is notable in this respect that
other hackish inventions (for example, in vocabulary) also tend to carry very
precise shades of meaning even when constructed to appear slangy and loose.
In fact, to a hacker, the contrast between ‘loose’ form and
‘tight’ content in jargon is a substantial part of its
humor!</p><p>Hackers have also developed a number of punctuation and emphasis
conventions adapted to single-font all-ASCII communications links, and these
are occasionally carried over into written documents even when normal means of
font changes, underlining, and the like are available.</p><p>One of these is that TEXT IN ALL CAPS IS INTERPRETED AS
‘LOUD’, and this becomes such an ingrained synesthetic reflex that
a person who goes to caps-lock while in <a href="T/talk-mode.html"><i class="glossterm">talk mode</i></a> may
be asked to “<span class="quote">stop shouting, please, you're hurting my
ears!</span>”.</p><p>Also, it is common to use bracketing with unusual characters to signify
emphasis.  The asterisk is most common, as in “<span class="quote">What the *hell*?</span>”
even though this interferes with the common use of the asterisk suffix as a
footnote mark.  The underscore is also common, suggesting underlining (this is
particularly common with book titles; for example, “<span class="quote">It is often alleged
that Joe Haldeman wrote _The_Forever_War_ as a rebuttal to Robert Heinlein's
earlier novel of the future military, _Starship_Troopers_.</span>”).  Other
forms exemplified by “<span class="quote">=hell=</span>”, “<span class="quote">\hell/</span>”, or
“<span class="quote">/hell/</span>” are occasionally seen (it's claimed that in the last
example the first slash pushes the letters over to the right to make them
italic, and the second keeps them from falling over).  On FidoNet, you might
see #bright# and ^dark^ text, which was actually interpreted by some reader
software.  Finally, words may also be emphasized L I K E T H I S, or by a
series of carets (^) under them on the next line of the text.</p><p>There is a semantic difference between *emphasis like this* (which
emphasizes the phrase as a whole), and *emphasis* *like* *this* (which
suggests the writer speaking very slowly and distinctly, as if to a very young
child or a mentally impaired person).  Bracketing a word with the
‘*’ character may also indicate that the writer wishes readers to
consider that an action is taking place or that a sound is being made.
Examples: *bang*, *hic*, *ring*, *grin*, *kick*, *stomp*, *mumble*.</p><p>One might also see the above sound effects as &lt;bang&gt;, &lt;hic&gt;,
&lt;ring&gt;, &lt;grin&gt;, &lt;kick&gt;, &lt;stomp&gt;, &lt;mumble&gt;.  This
use of angle brackets to mark their contents originally derives from
conventions used in <a href="B/BNF.html"><i class="glossterm">BNF</i></a>, but since about 1993 it has
been reinforced by the HTML markup used on the World Wide Web.</p><p>Angle-bracket enclosure is also used to indicate that a term stands for
some <a href="R/random.html"><i class="glossterm">random</i></a> member of a larger class (this is straight
from <a href="B/BNF.html"><i class="glossterm">BNF</i></a>). Examples like the following are common:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>So this &lt;ethnic&gt; walks into a bar one day...</p></blockquote></div><p>There is also an accepted convention for ‘writing under
erasure’; the text&gt;</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman, he's visiting from corporate
HQ.</p></blockquote></div><p>reads roughly as “Be nice to this fool, er,
gentleman...”, with irony emphasized.  The digraph ^H is often
used as a print representation for a backspace, and was actually very visible
on old-style printing terminals. As the text was being composed the characters
would be echoed and printed immediately, and when a correction was made the
backspace keystrokes would be echoed with the string ‘^H’.  Of
course, the final composed text would have no trace of the backspace
characters (or the original erroneous text).</p><p>Accidental writing under erasure occurs when using the Unix
<b class="command">talk</b> program to chat interactively to another user. On a
PC-style keyboard most users instinctively press the backspace key to delete
mistakes, but this may not achieve the desired effect, and merely displays a
^H symbol. The user typically presses backspace a few times before their brain
realises the problem — especially likely if the user is a touch-typist
— and since each character is transmitted as soon as it is typed,
Freudian slips and other inadvertent admissions are (barring network delays)
clearly visible for the other user to see.</p><p>Deliberate use of ^H for writing under erasure parallels (and may have
been influenced by) the ironic use of ‘slashouts’ in
science-fiction fanzines.</p><p>A related habit uses editor commands to signify corrections to previous
text.  This custom faded in email as more mailers got good editing
capabilities, only to take on new life on IRCs and other line-based chat
systems.</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">
charlie: I've seen that term used on alt.foobar often. 
lisa: Send it to Erik for the File.
lisa: Oops...s/Erik/Eric/.
</pre></td></tr></table><p>The s/Erik/Eric/ says “<span class="quote">change Erik to Eric in the
preceding</span>”.  This syntax is borrowed from the Unix editing tools
<b class="command">ed</b> and <b class="command">sed</b>, but is widely recognized by
non-Unix hackers as well. </p><p>In a formula, * signifies multiplication but two asterisks in a row are
a shorthand for exponentiation (this derives from FORTRAN, and is also used in
Ada).  Thus, one might write 2 ** 8 = 256.</p><p>Another notation for exponentiation one sees more frequently uses the
caret (^, ASCII 1011110); one might write instead 2^8 = 256.  This goes all
the way back to Algol-60, which used the archaic ASCII ‘up-arrow’
that later became the caret; this was picked up by Kemeny and Kurtz's original
BASIC, which in turn influenced the design of the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">bc</span>(1)</span>
and
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dc</span>(1)</span>
Unix tools, which have probably done most to reinforce the convention on
Usenet. (TeX math mode also uses ^ for exponention.) The notation is mildly
confusing to C programmers, because ^ means bitwise exclusive-or in C.
Despite this, it was favored 3:1 over ** in a late-1990 snapshot of Usenet.
It is used consistently in this lexicon.</p><p>In on-line exchanges, hackers tend to use decimal forms or improper
fractions (‘3.5’ or ‘7/2’) rather than
‘typewriter style’ mixed fractions (‘3-1/2’).  The
major motive here is probably that the former are more readable in a
monospaced font, together with a desire to avoid the risk that the latter
might be read as ‘three minus one-half’.  The decimal form is
definitely preferred for fractions with a terminating decimal representation;
there may be some cultural influence here from the high status of scientific
notation.</p><p>Another on-line convention, used especially for very large or very small
numbers, is taken from C (which derived it from FORTRAN).  This is a form of
‘scientific notation’ using ‘e’ to replace
‘*10^’; for example, one year is about 3e7 (that is, 3 × 10
<sup>7</sup>) seconds long.</p><p>The tilde (~) is commonly used in a quantifying sense of
‘approximately’; that is, <tt class="literal">~50</tt> means
‘about fifty’.</p><p>On Usenet and in the <a href="M/MUD.html"><i class="glossterm">MUD</i></a> world, common C boolean,
logical, and relational operators such as <tt class="literal">|</tt>,
<tt class="literal">&amp;</tt>, <tt class="literal">||</tt>,
<tt class="literal">&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt class="literal">!</tt>, <tt class="literal">==</tt>,
<tt class="literal">!=</tt>, <tt class="literal">&gt;</tt>, <tt class="literal">&lt;</tt>,
<tt class="literal">&gt;=</tt>, and <tt class="literal">&lt;=</tt> are often combined with
English.  The Pascal not-equals, <tt class="literal">&lt;&gt;</tt>, is also
recognized, and occasionally one sees <tt class="literal">/=</tt> for not-equals
(from Ada, Common Lisp, and Fortran 90).  The use of prefix ‘!’ as
a loose synonym for ‘not-’ or ‘no-’ is particularly
common; thus, ‘!clue’ is read ‘no-clue’ or
‘clueless’. </p><p>A related practice borrows syntax from preferred programming languages
to express ideas in a natural-language text.  For example, one might see the
following:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">

I guess they figured the price premium for true

Unfortunately, it's also the only workable approach.

construed as the official position of my employer.</span>” </p><p>The top section in the example, with &lt; at the left margin, is an
example of an inclusion convention we'll discuss below. </p><p>More recently, following on the huge popularity of the World Wide Web,
pseudo-HTML markup has become popular for similar purposes:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="screen">

&lt;flame intensity=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;

&lt;/flame&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table><p>Another recent (late 1990s) construction now common on Usenet seems to
be borrowed from Unix shell syntax or Perl.  It consists of using a dollar
sign before an uppercased form of a word or acronym to suggest any
<a href="R/random.html"><i class="glossterm">random</i></a> member of the class indicated by the word.
Thus: ‘$PHB’ means “<span class="quote">any random member of the class
‘Pointy-Haired Boss’</span>”.</p><p>Hackers also mix letters and numbers more freely than in mainstream
usage.  In particular, it is good hackish style to write a digit sequence
where you intend the reader to understand the text string that names that
number in English.  So, hackers prefer to write ‘1970s’ rather
than ‘nineteen-seventies’ or ‘1970's’ (the latter
looks like a possessive).</p><p>It should also be noted that hackers exhibit much less reluctance to use
multiply-nested parentheses than is normal in English.  Part of this is almost
certainly due to influence from LISP (which uses deeply nested parentheses
(like this (see?)) in its syntax a lot), but it has also been suggested that a
more basic hacker trait of enjoying playing with complexity and pushing
systems to their limits is in operation.</p><p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that many studies of on-line
communication have shown that electronic links have a de-inhibiting effect on
people.  Deprived of the body-language cues through which emotional state is
expressed, people tend to forget everything about other parties except what is
presented over that ASCII link.  This has both good and bad effects.  A good
one is that it encourages honesty and tends to break down hierarchical
authority relationships; a bad one is that it may encourage depersonalization
and gratuitous rudeness.  Perhaps in response to this, experienced netters
often display a sort of conscious formal
<span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">politesse</i></span> in their writing that has passed out
of fashion in other spoken and written media (for example, the phrase
“<span class="quote">Well said, sir!</span>” is not uncommon).</p><p>Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person
communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely because
they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing with people and
thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would face to face.</p><p>Though it is considered gauche to publicly criticize posters for poor
spelling or grammar, the network places a premium on literacy and clarity of
expression.  It may well be that future historians of literature will see in
it a revival of the great tradition of personal letters as art.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="comparatives.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="email-style.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Comparatives </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 6. Email Quotes and Inclusion Conventions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
