MIT AI Lab about various noted hackers.  The original koans were composed by
Danny Hillis, who would later found Connection Machines, Inc.  In reading
these, it is at least useful to know that Minsky, Sussman, and Drescher are AI
researchers of note, that Tom Knight was one of the Lisp machine's principal
designers, and that David Moon wrote much of Lisp Machine Lisp.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id3141171"/>Tom Knight and the Lisp Machine</h3></div></div><div/></div><p>A novice was trying to fix a broken Lisp machine by turning the power
