technical cultures including the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI lab (SAIL), and
others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities including Bolt, Beranek
and Newman (BBN), Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU), and Worcester Polytechnic
Institute (WPI).</p><p>The Jargon File (hereafter referred to as ‘jargon-1’ or
‘the File’) was begun by Raphael Finkel at Stanford in 1975.  From
this time until the plug was finally pulled on the SAIL computer in 1991, the
File was named AIWORD.RF[UP,DOC] there.  Some terms in it date back
considerably earlier (<a href="F/frob.html"><i class="glossterm">frob</i></a> and some senses of
<a href="M/moby.html"><i class="glossterm">moby</i></a>, for instance, go back to the Tech Model Railroad
Club at MIT and are believed to date at least back to the early 1960s).  The
revisions of jargon-1 were all unnumbered and may be collectively considered
‘Version 1’.</p><p>In 1976, Mark Crispin, having seen an announcement about the File on the
SAIL computer, FTPed a copy of the File to MIT.  He
noticed that it was hardly restricted to ‘AI words’ and so stored
the file on his directory as AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON.</p><p>The file was quickly renamed JARGON &gt; (the ‘&gt;’ caused
versioning under ITS) as a flurry of enhancements were made by Mark Crispin
and Guy L.  Steele Jr.  Unfortunately, amidst all this activity, nobody
thought of correcting the term ‘jargon’ to ‘slang’
until the compendium had already become widely known as the Jargon
File.</p><p>Raphael Finkel dropped out of active participation shortly thereafter
and Don Woods became the SAIL contact for the File (which was subsequently
kept in duplicate at SAIL and MIT, with periodic resynchronizations).</p><p>The File expanded by fits and starts until about 1983; Richard Stallman
was prominent among the contributors, adding many MIT and ITS-related
coinages.</p><p>In Spring 1981, a hacker named Charles Spurgeon got a large chunk of the
File published in Stewart Brand's <i class="citetitle">CoEvolution Quarterly</i>
(issue 29, pages 26—35) with illustrations by Phil Wadler and Guy Steele
(including a couple of the Crunchly cartoons).  This appears to have been the
File's first paper publication.</p><p>A late version of jargon-1, expanded with commentary for the mass
market, was edited by Guy Steele into a book published in 1983 as
<i class="citetitle">The Hacker's Dictionary</i> (Harper &amp; Row CN 1082, ISBN
0-06-091082-8).  The other jargon-1 editors (Raphael Finkel, Don Woods, and
Mark Crispin) contributed to this revision, as did Richard M. Stallman and
Geoff Goodfellow.  This book (now out of print) is hereafter referred to as
‘Steele-1983’ and those six as the Steele-1983 coauthors.</p><p>Shortly after the publication of Steele-1983, the File effectively
stopped growing and changing.  Originally, this was due to a desire to freeze
the file temporarily to facilitate the production of Steele-1983, but external
conditions caused the ‘temporary’ freeze to become
permanent.</p><p>The AI Lab culture had been hit hard in the late 1970s by funding cuts
and the resulting administrative decision to use vendor-supported hardware and
software instead of homebrew whenever possible.  At MIT, most AI work had
turned to dedicated LISP Machines.  At the same time, the commercialization of
AI technology lured some of the AI Lab's best and brightest away to startups
along the Route 128 strip in Massachusetts and out West in Silicon Valley.
The startups built LISP machines for MIT; the central MIT-AI computer became a
<a href="T/TWENEX.html"><i class="glossterm">TWENEX</i></a> system rather than a host for the AI hackers'
beloved <a href="I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a>. </p><p>The Stanford AI Lab had effectively ceased to exist by 1980, although
the SAIL computer continued as a Computer Science Department resource until
1991.  Stanford became a major <a href="T/TWENEX.html"><i class="glossterm">TWENEX</i></a> site, at one
point operating more than a dozen TOPS-20 systems; but by the mid-1980s most
of the interesting software work was being done on the emerging BSD Unix
standard.  </p><p>In April 1983, the PDP-10-centered cultures that had nourished the File
were dealt a death-blow by the cancellation of the Jupiter project at Digital
Equipment Corporation.  The File's compilers, already dispersed, moved on to
other things.  Steele-1983 was partly a monument to what its authors thought
was a dying tradition; no one involved realized at the time just how wide its
influence was to be.</p><p>By the mid-1980s the File's content was dated, but the legend that had
grown up around it never quite died out.  The book, and softcopies obtained
off the ARPANET, circulated even in cultures far removed from MIT and
Stanford; the content exerted a strong and continuing influence on hacker
language and humor.  Even as the advent of the microcomputer and other trends
fueled a tremendous expansion of hackerdom, the File (and related materials
such as the <a href="koans.html" title="Some AI Koans">Some AI Koans</a> in Appendix A) came to
be seen as a sort of sacred epic, a hacker-culture Matter of Britain
chronicling the heroic exploits of the Knights of the Lab.  The pace of change
in hackerdom at large accelerated tremendously — but the Jargon File,
having passed from living document to icon, remained essentially untouched for
seven years.</p><p>This revision contains nearly the entire text of a late version of
jargon-1 (a few obsolete PDP-10-related entries were dropped after careful
consultation with the editors of Steele-1983).  It merges in about 80% of the
Steele-1983 text, omitting some framing material and a very few entries
introduced in Steele-1983 that are now also obsolete.</p><p>This new version casts a wider net than the old Jargon File; its aim is
to cover not just AI or PDP-10 hacker culture but all the technical computing
cultures wherein the true hacker-nature is manifested.  More than half of the
entries now derive from <a href="U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a> and represent jargon now
current in the C and Unix communities, but special efforts have been made to
collect jargon from other cultures including IBM PC programmers, Amiga fans,
Mac enthusiasts, and even the IBM mainframe world.</p><p>Eric S. Raymond <tt class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">esr@thyrsus.com</a>&gt;</tt> maintains the new File

major.minor.revision.  Major version 1 is reserved for the ‘old’
(ITS) Jargon File, jargon-1. Major version 2 encompasses revisions by ESR
(Eric S. Raymond) with assistance from GLS (Guy L.  Steele, Jr.) leading up to
and including the second paper edition.  From now on, major version number
N.00 will probably correspond to the Nth paper edition.  Usually later
versions will either completely supersede or incorporate earlier versions, so
there is generally no point in keeping old versions around.</p><p>Our thanks to the coauthors of Steele-1983 for oversight and assistance,
