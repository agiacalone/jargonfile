[from Virtual Address eXtension] The most successful minicomputer
   design in industry history, possibly excepting its immediate ancestor, the
   <a href="../P/PDP-11.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-11</i></a>.  Between its release in 1978 and its eclipse
   by <a href="../K/killer-micro.html"><i class="glossterm">killer micro</i></a>s after about 1986, the VAX was
   probably the hacker's favorite machine of them all, esp. after the 1982
   release of 4.2 BSD Unix (see <a href="../B/BSD.html"><i class="glossterm">BSD</i></a>).  Especially noted
   for its large, assembler-programmer-friendly instruction set &#8212; an
   asset that became a liability after the RISC revolution.</p><p>It is worth noting that the standard plural of VAX was
   &#8216;vaxen&#8217; and that VAX system operators were sometimes referred
   to as &#8216;vaxherds&#8217;</p></dd><dd><p> 2. A major brand of vacuum cleaner in Britain.  Cited here because
   its sales pitch, &#8220;<span class="quote">Nothing sucks like a VAX!</span>&#8221; became a sort of
   battle-cry of RISC partisans.  It is even sometimes claimed that DEC
   actually entered a cross-licensing deal with the vacuum-Vax people that
   allowed them to market VAX computers in the U.K. in return for not
   challenging the vacuum cleaner trademark in the U.S.</p><p>A rival brand actually pioneered the slogan: its original form was
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Nothing sucks like Electrolux</span>&#8221;.  It has apparently become a
   classic example (used in advertising textbooks) of the perils of not
   knowing the local idiom.  But in 1996, the press manager of Electrolux AB,
   while confirming that the company used this slogan in the late 1960s, also
   tells us that their marketing people were fully aware of the possible
   double entendre and intended it to gain attention.</p><p>And gain attention it did &#8212; the VAX-vacuum-cleaner people
   thought the slogan a sufficiently good idea to copy it.  Several British
   hackers report that VAX's promotions used it in 1986--1987, and we have one
   report from a New Zealander that the infamous slogan surfaced there in TV
   ads for the product in 1992.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="vaston.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../V.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="VAXen.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">vaston </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> VAXen</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
