   program that searches out other programs and &#8216;infects&#8217; them by
   embedding a copy of itself in them, so that they become <a href="../T/Trojan-horse.html"><i class="glossterm">Trojan
   horse</i></a>s.  When these programs are executed, the embedded virus
   is executed too, thus propagating the &#8216;infection&#8217;.  This
   normally happens invisibly to the user.  Unlike a
   <a href="../W/worm.html"><i class="glossterm">worm</i></a>, a virus cannot infect other computers without
   assistance.  It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs
   with their friends (see <a href="../S/SEX.html"><i class="glossterm">SEX</i></a>).  The virus may do
   nothing but propagate itself and then allow the program to run normally.
   Usually, however, after propagating silently for a while, it starts doing
   things like writing cute messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks
   with the display (some viruses include nice <a href="../D/display-hack.html"><i class="glossterm">display
   hack</i></a>s).  Many nasty viruses, written by particularly perversely
   minded <a href="../C/cracker.html"><i class="glossterm">cracker</i></a>s, do irreversible damage, like nuking
   all the user's files.</p><p>In the 1990s, viruses became a serious problem, especially among
   Windows users; the lack of security on these machines enables viruses to
   spread easily, even infecting the operating system (Unix machines, by
   contrast, are immune to such attacks).  The production of special
   anti-virus software has become an industry, and a number of exaggerated
   media reports have caused outbreaks of near hysteria among users; many
   <a href="../L/luser.html"><i class="glossterm">luser</i></a>s tend to blame <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span>
   that doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks.  Accordingly, this
   sense of <span class="firstterm">virus</span> has passed not only
   into techspeak but into also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly
   used to denote a <a href="../W/worm.html"><i class="glossterm">worm</i></a> or even a <a href="../T/Trojan-horse.html"><i class="glossterm">Trojan
   horse</i></a>).  See <a href="../P/phage.html"><i class="glossterm">phage</i></a>; compare
