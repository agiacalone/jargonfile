   not only do you check your email more often than your paper mail, but you
   remember your <a href="../N/network-address.html"><i class="glossterm">network address</i></a> faster than your

   hackers may have trouble spotting the ringer.</span>&#8221; The ringer was
   balancing one's checkbook in octal, which I made up out of whole cloth.
   Although more respondents picked that one out as fiction than any of the

   happening, most famously to Grace Hopper while she was working with BINAC
   in 1949. &#8212;ESR]</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="You-are-not-expected-to-understand-this.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../Y.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Your-mileage-may-vary.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">You are not expected to understand this </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Your mileage may vary</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
