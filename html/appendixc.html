created it grow and flourish.  Here are several ways you can help:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If you are a writer or journalist, don't say or write
<a href="H/hacker.html"><i class="glossterm">hacker</i></a> when you mean <a href="C/cracker.html"><i class="glossterm">cracker</i></a>.
If you work with writers or journalists, educate them on this issue and push
them to do the right thing. If you catch a newspaper or magazine abusing the
word ‘hacker’, write them and straighten them out (this appendix
includes a model letter).</p></li><li><p>If you're a techie or computer hobbyist, get involved with one
of the free Unixes.  Toss out that lame Microsoft OS, or confine it to one
disk partition and put Linux or FreeBSD or NetBSD on the other one.  And the
next time your friend or boss is thinking about some proprietary software
‘solution’ that costs more than it's worth, be ready to blow the
competition away with open-source software running over a
Unix.</p></li><li><p>Contribute to organizations like the Free Software Foundation
that promote the production of high-quality free and open-source software.
You can reach the Free Software Foundation at <tt class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:gnu@gnu.org">gnu@gnu.org</a>&gt;</tt>, by
phone at +1-617-542-5942, or by snail-mail at 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA.</p></li><li><p>Support the League for Programming Freedom, which opposes
over-broad software patents that constantly threaten to blow up in hackers'
faces, preventing them from developing innovative software for tomorrow's
needs.  You can reach the League for Programming Freedom at

the Center for Democracy and Technology Home Page at <a href="http://www.cdt.org/" target="_top">http://www.cdt.org/</a>.</p></li><li><p>If you do nothing else, please help fight government attempts
to seize political control of Internet content and restrict strong
cryptography.  The so-called ‘Communications Decency Act’ was
declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, but U.S. cryptography policy
still infringes our First Amendment rights.  Surf to the Center for Democracy

to help fight censorship of the net.</p></li></ul></div><p>Here's the text of a letter RMS wrote to the Wall Street Journal to
complain about their policy of using “<span class="quote">hacker</span>” only in a
pejorative sense.  We hear that most major newspapers have the same policy.
If you'd like to help change this situation, send your favorite newspaper the
same letter — or, better yet, write your own letter.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This letter is not meant for publication, although you can publish it if
you wish.  It is meant specifically for you, the editor, not the
public. </p><p>I am a hacker.  That is to say, I enjoy playing with computers —
working with, learning about, and writing clever computer programs.  I am not
a cracker; I don't make a practice of breaking computer security. </p><p>There's nothing shameful about the hacking I do.  But when I tell people
I am a hacker, people think I'm admitting something naughty — because
newspapers such as yours misuse the word “<span class="quote">hacker</span>”, giving the
impression that it means “<span class="quote">security breaker</span>” and nothing else.
You are giving hackers a bad name. </p><p>The saddest thing is that this problem is perpetuated deliberately.
Your reporters know the difference between “<span class="quote">hacker</span>” and
“<span class="quote">security breaker</span>”.  They know how to make the distinction, but
you don't let them!  You insist on using “<span class="quote">hacker</span>” pejoratively.
When reporters try to use another word, you change it.  When reporters try to
explain the other meanings, you cut it.</p><p>Of course, you have a reason.  You say that readers have become used to
your insulting usage of “<span class="quote">hacker</span>”, so that you cannot change it
now.  Well, you can't undo past mistakes today; but that is no excuse to
repeat them tomorrow.</p><p>If I were what you call a “<span class="quote">hacker</span>”, at this point I would
threaten to crack your computer and crash it.  But I am a hacker, not a
cracker.  I don't do that kind of thing!  I have enough computers to play with
at home and at work; I don't need yours.  Besides, it's not my way to respond
to insults with violence.  My response is this letter.</p><p>You owe hackers an apology; but more than that, you owe us ordinary
respect.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="miscellaneous.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pt03.html#bibliography">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Miscellaneous </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Bibliography</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
