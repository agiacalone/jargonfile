   <a href="scratch-monkey.html"><i class="glossterm">scratch monkey</i></a></span>&#8221;, a proverb used to advise
   caution when dealing with irreplaceable data or devices.  Used to refer to
   any scratch volume hooked to a computer during any risky operation as a
   replacement for some precious resource or data that might otherwise get
   trashed.</p><p>This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey,
   star of a biological research program at the University of Toronto.  Mabel
   was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the university had spent
   years teaching her how to swim, breathing through a regulator, in order to
   study the effects of different gas mixtures on her physiology.  Mabel
   suffered an untimely demise one day when a <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a>
   <a href="../F/field-circus.html"><i class="glossterm">field circus</i></a> engineer troubleshooting a crash on the
   program's <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a> inadvertently interfered with some
   custom hardware that was wired to Mabel.</p><p>It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the <a href="../F/field-circus.html"><i class="glossterm">field circus</i></a> manager
   responsible and asked him sweetly, &#8220;<span class="quote">Can you swim?</span>&#8221; Not all the
   consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of the machine in
   question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of certain clueless
   <a href="../D/droid.html"><i class="glossterm">droid</i></a>s at the local &#8216;humane&#8217; society.
   The moral is clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.  [The
   actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of this story,
   complete with reported dialogue between one of the project people and DEC
   field service, that has been circulating on Internet since 1986.  It is
   hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong.  For example, it reports
   the machine as a <a href="../P/PDP-11.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-11</i></a> and alleges that Mabel's demise occurred when DEC
   <a href="../P/PM.html"><i class="glossterm">PM</i></a>ed the machine.  Earlier versions of this entry
   were based on that story; this one has been corrected from an interview
   with the hapless sysop. &#8212;ESR]</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="scratch.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="scream-and-die.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">scratch </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> scream and die</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
