One speaks of
   the next project to be attacked as having risen to the top of the stack.
   &#8220;<span class="quote">I'm afraid I've got real work to do, so this'll have to be pushed
   way down on my stack.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">I haven't done it yet because every
   time I pop my stack something new gets pushed.</span>&#8221; If you are
   interrupted several times in the middle of a conversation, &#8220;<span class="quote">My stack
   overflowed</span>&#8221; means &#8220;<span class="quote">I forget what we were talking
   about.</span>&#8221; The implication is that more items were pushed onto the
   stack than could be remembered, so the least recent items were lost.  The
   usual physical example of a stack is to be found in a cafeteria: a pile of
   plates or trays sitting on a spring in a well, so that when you put one on
   the top they all sink down, and when you take one off the top the rest
   spring up a bit.  See also <a href="../P/push.html"><i class="glossterm">push</i></a> and
   <a href="../P/pop.html"><i class="glossterm">pop</i></a>.</p><p>(<i class="citetitle">The Art of Computer Programming</i>, second
   edition, vol. 1, p. 236) says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Many people who realized the
   importance of stacks and queues independently have given other names to
   these structures: stacks have been called push-down lists, reversion
   storages, cellars, nesting stores, piles, last-in-first-out
   (&#8220;<span class="quote">LIFO</span>&#8221;) lists, and even yo-yo lists!
   </p></blockquote></div><p>The term &#8220;<span class="quote">stack</span>&#8221; was originally coined by Edsger 
   Dijkstra, who was quite proud of it.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="squirrelcide.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="stack-puke.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">squirrelcide </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> stack puke</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
