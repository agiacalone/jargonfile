To crash a program by overrunning a fixed-size buffer with
   excessively large input data.  See also 
   <a href="../B/buffer-overflow.html"><i class="glossterm">buffer overflow</i></a>, <a href="../O/overrun-screw.html"><i class="glossterm">overrun screw</i></a>,
   <a href="smash-the-stack.html"><i class="glossterm">smash the stack</i></a>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. To cause a newsgroup to be flooded with irrelevant or
   inappropriate messages. You can spam a newsgroup with as little as one
   well- (or ill-) planned message (e.g. asking &#8220;<span class="quote">What do you think of
   abortion?</span>&#8221; on <tt class="systemitem">soc.women</tt>).
   This is often done with <a href="../C/cross-post.html"><i class="glossterm">cross-post</i></a>ing (e.g. any
   message which is cross-posted to <tt class="systemitem">alt.rush-limbaugh</tt> and <tt class="systemitem">alt.politics.homosexuality</tt> will almost
   inevitably spam both groups). This overlaps with
   <a href="../T/troll.html"><i class="glossterm">troll</i></a> behavior; the latter more specific term has
   become more common. </p></dd><dd><p> 3. To send many identical or nearly-identical messages separately to
   a large number of Usenet newsgroups. This is more specifically called
   <span class="firstterm">ECP</span>, Excessive Cross-Posting.  This
   is one sure way to infuriate nearly everyone on the Net. See also
   <a href="../V/velveeta.html"><i class="glossterm">velveeta</i></a> and <a href="../J/jello.html"><i class="glossterm">jello</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p> 4. To bombard a newsgroup with multiple copies of a message.  This
   is more specifically called <span class="firstterm">EMP</span>,
   Excessive Multi-Posting.  </p></dd><dd><p> 5.  To mass-mail unrequested identical or nearly-identical email
   messages, particularly those containing advertising.  Especially used when
   the mail addresses have been culled from network traffic or databases
   without the consent of the recipients. Synonyms include
   <a href="../U/UCE.html"><i class="glossterm">UCE</i></a>, <a href="../U/UBE.html"><i class="glossterm">UBE</i></a>.
   As a noun, &#8216;spam&#8217; refers to the messages so sent.</p></dd><dd><p> 6. Any large, annoying, quantity of output.  For instance, someone
   on IRC who walks away from their screen and comes back to find 200 lines of
   text might say &#8220;<span class="quote">Oh no, spam</span>&#8221;.</p></dd><dd><p>The later definitions have become much more prevalent as the Internet
   has opened up to non-techies, and to most people senses 3 4 and 5 are now
   primary.  All three behaviors are considered abuse of the net, and are
   almost universally grounds for termination of the originator's email
   account or network connection.  In these senses the term &#8216;spam&#8217;
   has gone mainstream, though without its original sense or folkloric freight
   &#8212; there is apparently a widespread myth among
   <a href="../L/luser.html"><i class="glossterm">luser</i></a>s that &#8220;<span class="quote">spamming</span>&#8221; is what happens
   when you dump cans of Spam into a revolving fan.  Hormel, the makers of
   Spam, have published a surprisingly enlightened <a href="http://www.spam.com/ci/ci_in.htm" target="_top"> position statement</a> on the
   Internet usage.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="spaghetti-inheritance.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="spam-bait.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">spaghetti inheritance </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> spam bait</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
