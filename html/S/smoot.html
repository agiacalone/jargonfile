The length of
   the Harvard Bridge in Boston is famously 364.4 smoots plus an ear (the ear
   is allegedly the width of the earhole in the side of the football helmet
   the victim was wearing when he was rolled over the bridge). This legend
   began with a fraternity prank in 1958 during which the body length of
   Oliver Smoot (class of '62) was actually used to measure out that distance.
   It is commemorated by smoot marks that MIT students repaint every few
   years; the tradition even survived the demolition and rebuilding of the
   bridge in the late 1980s.  The Boston police have been known to use smoot
   markers to indicate accident locations on the bridge.  Apparently Smoot's
   experience as a unit of measurement led to a life-long career; he
   eventually became Chairman of the Board of the American National Standards
   Institute, and later President of the International Organization for
   Standardization.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="smoking-clover.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="SMOP.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">smoking clover </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> SMOP</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
