Software EXchange.  A technique invented by the blue-green algae
   hundreds of millions of years ago to speed up their evolution, which had
   been terribly slow up until then.  Today, SEX parties are popular among
   hackers and others (of course, these are no longer limited to exchanges of
   genetic software).  In general, SEX parties are a 
   <a href="../G/Good-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Good Thing</i></a>, but unprotected SEX can propagate a
   <a href="../V/virus.html"><i class="glossterm">virus</i></a>.  See also 
   <a href="../P/pubic-directory.html"><i class="glossterm">pubic directory</i></a>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. The rather Freudian mnemonic often used for Sign EXtend, a
   machine instruction found in the <a href="../P/PDP-11.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-11</i></a> and many
   other architectures.  The RCA 1802 chip used in the early Elf and SuperElf
   personal computers had a &#8216;SEt X register&#8217; SEX instruction, but
   this seems to have had little folkloric impact.  The Data General
   instruction set also had <b class="command">SEX</b>.</p><p><a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a>'s engineers nearly got a
   <a href="../P/PDP-11.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-11</i></a> assembler that used the <b class="command">SEX</b> mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for
   once) marketing wasn't asleep and forced a change.  That wasn't the last
   time this happened, either.  The author of <i class="citetitle">The Intel 8086
   Primer</i>, who was one of the original designers of the 8086,
   noted that there was originally a <b class="command">SEX</b>
   instruction on that processor, too.  He says that Intel management got cold
   feet and decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was renamed
   <b class="command">CBW</b> and <b class="command">CWD</b>
   (depending on what was being extended).  Amusingly, the Intel 8048 (the
   microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also missing straight <b class="command">SEX</b> but has logical-or and logical-and instructions
   <b class="command">ORL</b> and <b class="command">ANL</b>.</p><p>The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
   U.K.'s &#8216;Dragon 32&#8217; personal computer, actually had an official
   <b class="command">SEX</b> instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II
   with which it competed did not.  British hackers thought this made perfect
   mythic sense; after all, it was commonly observed, you could (on some
   theoretical level) have sex with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an
   apple.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="server.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="sex-changer.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">server </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> sex changer</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
