   used in a while to <a href="../L/lose.html"><i class="glossterm">lose</i></a>; such failure may be
   semi-humorously ascribed to <a href="../B/bit-rot.html"><i class="glossterm">bit rot</i></a>.  More commonly,
   <span class="firstterm">software rot</span> strikes when a program's
   assumptions become out of date.  If the design was insufficiently
   <a href="../R/robust.html"><i class="glossterm">robust</i></a>, this may cause it to fail in mysterious
   ways. Syn. <span class="firstterm">code rot</span>.  See also
   <a href="../L/link-rot.html"><i class="glossterm">link rot</i></a>.</p><p>For example, owing to endemic shortsightedness in the design of COBOL
   programs, a good number of them succumbed to software rot when their
   2-digit year counters underwent <a href="../W/wrap-around.html"><i class="glossterm">wrap around</i></a> at the
   beginning of the year 2000.  Actually, related lossages often afflict
   centenarians who have to deal with computer software designed by
   unimaginative clods.  One such incident became the focus of a minor public
   flap in 1990, when a gentleman born in 1889 applied for a driver's license
   renewal in Raleigh, North Carolina.  The new system refused to issue the
   card, probably because with 2-digit years the ages 101 and 1 cannot be
   distinguished.</p><p>Historical note: Software rot in an even funnier sense than the
   mythical one was a real problem on early research computers (e.g., the R1;
   see <a href="../G/grind-crank.html"><i class="glossterm">grind crank</i></a>).  If a program that depended on a
   peculiar instruction hadn't been run in quite a while, the user might
   discover that the opcodes no longer did the same things they once did.
   (&#8220;<span class="quote">Hey, so-and-so needs an instruction to do such-and-such.  We can
   <a href="snarf.html"><i class="glossterm">snarf</i></a> this opcode, right?  No one uses it.</span>&#8221;)
   Another classic example of this sprang from the time an MIT hacker found a
   simple way to double the speed of the unconditional jump instruction on a
   PDP-6, so he patched the hardware.  Unfortunately, this broke some fragile
   timing software in a music-playing program, throwing its output out of
   tune.  This was fixed by adding a defensive initialization routine to
   compare the speed of a timing loop with the real-time clock; in other
   words, it figured out how fast the PDP-6 was that day, and corrected
   appropriately.</p><p>Compare <a href="../B/bit-rot.html"><i class="glossterm">bit rot</i></a>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="software-laser.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="softwarily.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">software laser </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> softwarily</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
