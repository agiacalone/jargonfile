   <tt class="literal">N</tt> random broken people.</p><p>Here is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L.
   Steele:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT
   for many years.  One April, we both flew from Boston to California for a
   week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some people at
   Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.  Gabriel (RPG).</p><p>RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
   Palo Alto (going <a href="../L/logical.html"><i class="glossterm">logical</i></a> south on route 101,
   parallel to <a href="../E/El-Camino-Bignum.html"><i class="glossterm">El Camino Bignum</i></a>).  Palo Alto is
   adjacent to Stanford University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco.
   We ate at The Good Earth, a &#8216;health food&#8217; restaurant, very
   popular, the sort whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder.
   JONL ordered such a shake &#8212; the waitress claimed the flavor of the
   day was &#8220;<span class="quote">lalaberry</span>&#8221;.  I still have no idea what that might be,
   but it became a running joke.  It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said
   it tasted rather bitter.  I ate a better tostada there than I have ever had
   in a Mexican restaurant.</p><p>After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
   Cream Parlor.  They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of intriguing
   flavors.  It's a chain, and they have a slogan: &#8220;<span class="quote">If you don't live
   near an Uncle Gaylord's &#8212; MOVE!</span>&#8221; Also, Uncle Gaylord (a real
   person) wages a constant battle to force big-name ice cream makers to print
   their ingredients on the package (like air and plastic and other
   non-natural garbage).  JONL and I had first discovered Uncle Gaylord's the
   previous August, when we had flown to a computer-science conference in
   Berkeley, California, the first time either of us had been on the West
   Coast.  When not in the conference sessions, we had spent our time
   wandering the length of Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in
   Cambridge) was lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little
   shops.  On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store.  The
   ice cream there was very good.  During that August visit JONL went
   absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
   honey.</p><p>Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth &#8212; indeed, after every
   lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit &#8212; a trip to
   Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory.  We had arrived on a
   Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there at least four times.
   Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice cream, and proclaim to all
   bystanders that &#8220;<span class="quote">Ginger was the spice that drove the Europeans mad!
   That's why they sought a route to the East!  They used it to preserve their
   otherwise off-taste meat.</span>&#8221; After the third or fourth repetition RPG
   and I were getting a little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase
   him: &#8220;<span class="quote">Wow!  Ginger!  The spice that makes rotten meat taste
   good!</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Say!  Why don't we find some dog that's been run over
   and sat in the sun for a week and put some <span class="emphasis"><em>ginger</em></span> on
   it for dinner?!</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Right!  With a lalaberry shake!</span>&#8221; And
   so on.  This failed to faze JONL; he took it in good humor, as long as we
   kept returning to Uncle Gaylord's.  He loves ginger honey ice cream.</p><p>Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
   (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them JONL
   and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their choosing.  I
   unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had <span class="i">je
   ne sais quoi du jour</span>, but RPG and JONL had <span class="i">lapin</span> (rabbit).  (Waitress: &#8220;<span class="quote"><span class="i">Oui</span>, we have fresh rabbit, fresh today.</span>&#8221; RPG:
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Well, JONL, I guess we won't need any
   <span class="emphasis"><em>ginger</em></span>!</span>&#8221;)</p><p>We finished the meal late, about 11PM, which is 2AM Boston time, so
   JONL and I were rather droopy.  But it wasn't yet midnight.  Off to Uncle
   Gaylord's!</p><p>Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.
   In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north instead
   of south.  JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference had RPG not
   mentioned it.  We still knew very little of the local geography.  I did
   figure out, however, that we were headed in the direction of Berkeley, and
   half-jokingly suggested that we continue north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in
   Berkeley.</p><p>RPG said &#8220;<span class="quote">Fine!</span>&#8221; and we drove on for a while and talked.
   I was drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes.  When
   he awoke, RPG said, &#8220;<span class="quote">Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way over
   the bridge!</span>&#8221;, referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay.  Just
   then we came to a sign that said &#8220;<span class="quote">University Avenue</span>&#8221;.  I
   mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue; RPG said
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Right!</span>&#8221; and maneuvered some more.  Eventually we pulled up in
   front of an Uncle Gaylord's.</p><p>Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
   and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me in on it
   a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice that we had
   somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after all.</p><p>JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
   caught on.  (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night, and
   looks much different from the way it does in daylight.)  He said,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley!  It looked
   like a barn!  But this place looks <span class="emphasis"><em>just like</em></span> the one
   back in Palo Alto!</span>&#8221;</p><p>RPG deadpanned, &#8220;<span class="quote">Well, this is the one <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span>
   always come to when I'm in Berkeley.  They've got two in San Francisco,
   too.  Remember, they're a chain.</span>&#8221;</p><p>JONL accepted this bit of wisdom.  And he was not totally ignorant
   &#8212; he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley, not
   far from Telegraph Avenue.  What he didn't know was that there is a
   completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.</p><p>JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey.  The guy at
   the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first, evidently
   their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too many people like
   it.</p><p>JONL said, &#8220;<span class="quote">I'm sure I like it.  Just give me a cone.</span>&#8221;
   The guy behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first.
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Some people think it tastes like soap.</span>&#8221; JONL insisted,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Look, I <span class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> ginger.  I eat Chinese food.  I
   eat raw ginger roots.  I already went through this hassle with the guy back
   in Palo Alto.  I <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> I like that
   flavor!</span>&#8221;</p><p>At the words &#8220;<span class="quote">back in Palo Alto</span>&#8221; the guy behind the
   counter got a very strange look on his face, but said nothing.  KBT caught
   his eye and winked.  Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped what
   was going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor laughing and
   clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched into his spiel
   (&#8220;<span class="quote">makes rotten meat a dish for princes</span>&#8221;) for the forty-third
   time.  At this point, RPG clued me in fully.</p><p>RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our chuckles.
   JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream with the guy b.t.c.,
   comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream shops and generally having a
   good old time.</p><p>At length the g.b.t.c.: said, &#8220;<span class="quote">How's the ginger honey?</span>&#8221;
   JONL said, &#8220;<span class="quote">Fine!  I wonder what exactly is in it?</span>&#8221; Now Uncle
   Gaylord publishes all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make
   his ice cream at home.  So the g.b.t.c.: got out the recipe, and he and
   JONL pored over it for a while.  But the g.b.t.c.: could contain his
   curiosity no longer, and asked again, &#8220;<span class="quote">You really like that stuff,
   huh?</span>&#8221; JONL said, &#8220;<span class="quote">Yeah, I've been eating it constantly back in
   Palo Alto for the past two days.  In fact, I think this batch is about as
   good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto!</span>&#8221;</p><p>G.b.t.c.: looked him straight in the eye and said, &#8220;<span class="quote">You're
   <span class="emphasis"><em>in</em></span> Palo Alto!</span>&#8221;</p><p>JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a fit
   of giggles.  He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed, &#8220;<span class="quote">I've
   been hacked!</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>[My spies on the West Coast inform me that there is a close relative

   &#8212;ESR]</p><p>[Ironic footnote: the <a href="../M/meme.html"><i class="glossterm">meme</i></a> about ginger
   vs. rotting meat is an urban legend.  It's not borne out by an examination
   of medieval recipes or period purchase records for spices, and appears
   full-blown in the works of Samuel Pegge, a gourmand and notorious flake
   case who originated numerous food myths.  The truth seems to be that ginger
   was used to cover not rot but the extreme salt taste of meat packed in
   brine, which was the best method available before refrigeration.
