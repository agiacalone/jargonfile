Hackers remember that the name was originally an
   acronym, Stanford University Network.  Sun started out around 1980 with
   some hardware hackers (mainly) from Stanford talking to some software
   hackers (mainly) from UC Berkeley; Sun's original technology concept
   married a clever board design based on the Motorola 68000 to
   <a href="../B/BSD.html"><i class="glossterm">BSD</i></a> Unix.  Sun went on to lead the workstation
   industry through the 1980s, and for years afterwards remained an
   engineering-driven company and a good place for hackers to work.  Though
   Sun drifted away from its techie origins after 1990 and has since made some
   strategic moves that disappointed and annoyed many hackers (especially by
   maintaining proprietary control of Java and rejecting Linux), it's still
   considered within the family in much the same way
