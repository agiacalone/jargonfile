   Rope Axe Man</span>&#8221; coined by Enrico Fermi himself.  The story goes that
   in the earliest nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the
   possibility that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their
   mathematical models.  Accordingly, they made sure that they had mechanisms
   in place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into the reactor.
   One mechanism took the form of &#8216;scram technicians&#8217;.  These
   individuals stood next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered the
   control rods.  Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these technicians stood
   ready for the (literal) &#8216;scram&#8217; command.  If necessary, they
   would cut the cables, and gravity would expeditiously return the control
   rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet another kind of <a href="../C/core-dump.html"><i class="glossterm">core
   dump</i></a>.</p><p>Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
   held closed by current.  SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
   immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
   insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="SCNR.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="scratch.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">SCNR </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> scratch</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
