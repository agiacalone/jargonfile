A lower form of life found on 
   <a href="../T/talker-system.html"><i class="glossterm">talker system</i></a>s and <a href="../M/MUD.html"><i class="glossterm">MUD</i></a>s.  The spod has few
   friends in <a href="../R/RL.html"><i class="glossterm">RL</i></a> and uses talkers instead, finding
   communication easier and preferable over the net.  He has all the negative
   traits of the computer geek without having any interest in computers per
   se.  Lacking any knowledge of or interest in how networks work, and
   considering his access a God-given right, he is a major irritant to
   sysadmins, clogging up lines in order to reach new MUDs, following
   passed-on instructions on how to sneak his way onto Internet (&#8220;<span class="quote">Wow!
   It's in America!</span>&#8221;) and complaining when he is not allowed to use
   busy routes.  A true spod will start any conversation with &#8220;<span class="quote">Are you
   male or female?</span>&#8221; (and follow it up with &#8220;<span class="quote">Got any good
   numbers/IDs/passwords?</span>&#8221;) and will not talk to someone physically
   present in the same terminal room until they log onto the same machine that
   he is using and enter talk mode.  Compare <a href="../N/newbie.html"><i class="glossterm">newbie</i></a>,

   Obtain a Degree</span>&#8221;; according to some self-described spods, this term
   is used by indifferent students to condemn their harder-working
   fellows. Compare the defiant adoption of the term
   <a href="../G/geek.html"><i class="glossterm">geek</i></a> in the mid-1990s by people who would previously
   have been stigmatized by it. Spods in the positive sense are talker users
   who've accumulated a large amount of spod time, that is, they spend a lot
   of time logged in to that talker (for example, my spod time on Uberworld as
   of this moment is 131 days, 15 hours and 20 minutes). Spods are generally
   highly knowledgeable about talkers and SGXStalker coding, as well as
   computers and the internet in general.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. [Glasgow University] An otherwise competent hacker who spends way
   too much time on talker systems.  </p></dd><dd><p> 4. [obs.] An ordinary person; a <a href="../R/random.html"><i class="glossterm">random</i></a>.  This
   is the meaning with which the term was coined, but the inventor informs us
   he has himself accepted sense 1.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="splork-.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="spoiler.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">splork! </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> spoiler</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
