   A term applied by hackers to most OS vendors' favorite way of coping with
   security holes &#8212; namely, ignoring them, documenting neither any known
   holes nor the underlying security algorithms, trusting that nobody will
   find out about them and that people who do find out about them won't
   exploit them.  This &#8220;<span class="quote">strategy</span>&#8221; never works for long and
   occasionally sets the world up for debacles like the
   <a href="../R/RTM.html"><i class="glossterm">RTM</i></a> worm of 1988 (see 
   <a href="../G/Great-Worm.html"><i class="glossterm">Great Worm</i></a>), but once the brief moments of panic created by such
   events subside most vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to
   sleep.  After all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources
   needed to implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list
   &#8212; and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might
   begin to <span class="emphasis"><em>expect</em></span> it and imagine that their warranties
   of merchantability gave them some sort of <span class="emphasis"><em>right</em></span> to a
   system with fewer holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and
   <span class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span> where would we be?</p></dd><dd><p>Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term.  It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet
   newsgroup <tt class="systemitem">comp.sys.apollo</tt> during
   a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix security problems in its
   Unix-<a href="../C/clone.html"><i class="glossterm">clone</i></a> Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't change a
   thing).  <a href="../I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a> fans, on the other hand, say it was
   coined years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid
   <a href="../M/Multics.html"><i class="glossterm">Multics</i></a> people down the hall, for whom security was
   everything.  In the ITS culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the
   time a tourist figured out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over
   the urge to make it, because he felt part of the community; and (2)
   (self-mockingly) the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of
   many commands.  One instance of <span class="emphasis"><em>deliberate</em></span> security
   through obscurity is recorded; the command to allow patching the running
   ITS system (escape escape control-R) echoed as $$^D.  If you actually typed
   alt alt ^D, that set a flag that would prevent patching the system even if
   you later got it right.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="secondary-damage.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../S.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="SED.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">secondary damage </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> SED</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
