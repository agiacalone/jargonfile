   waking-sleeping schedule with respect to the standard 24-hour cycle; a
   useful concept among people who often work at night and/or according to no
   fixed schedule.  It is not uncommon to change one's phase by as much as 6
   hours per day on a regular basis.  &#8220;<span class="quote">What's your phase?</span>&#8221;
   &#8220;<span class="quote">I've been getting in about 8PM lately, but I'm going to
   <a href="../W/wrap-around.html"><i class="glossterm">wrap around</i></a> to the day schedule by Friday.</span>&#8221; A
   person who is roughly 12 hours out of phase is sometimes said to be in
   <span class="firstterm">night mode</span>.  (The term <span class="firstterm">day mode</span> is also (but less frequently) used,
   meaning you're working 9 to 5 (or, more likely, 10 to 6).)  The act of
   altering one's cycle is called <span class="firstterm">changing
   phase</span>; <span class="firstterm">phase shifting</span> has
   also been recently reported from Caltech.</p></dd><dd><p> 2. <span class="firstterm">change phase the hard way</span>:
   To stay awake for a very long time in order to get into a different phase.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 3. <span class="firstterm">change phase the easy way</span>:
   To stay asleep, etc.  However, some claim that either staying awake longer
   or sleeping longer is easy, and that it is <span class="emphasis"><em>shortening</em></span>
   your day or night that is really hard (see 
   <a href="../W/wrap-around.html"><i class="glossterm">wrap around</i></a>).  The &#8216;jet lag&#8217; that afflicts travelers who
   cross many time-zone boundaries may be attributed to two distinct causes:
   the strain of travel per se, and the strain of changing phase.  Hackers who
   suddenly find that they must change phase drastically in a short period of
   time, particularly the hard way, experience something very like jet lag
   without traveling.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="phage.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="phase-of-the-moon.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">phage </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> phase of the moon</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
