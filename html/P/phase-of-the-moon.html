   depend.  Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent, or that
   reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been able to
   determine.  &#8220;<span class="quote">This feature depends on having the channel open in
   mumble mode, having the foo switch set, and on the phase of the
   moon.</span>&#8221; See also <a href="../H/heisenbug.html"><i class="glossterm">heisenbug</i></a>.</p><p>True story: Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did
   depend on the phase of the moon.  There was a little subroutine that had
   traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an
   approximation to the moon's true phase.  GLS incorporated this routine into
   a LISP program that, when it wrote out a file, would print a timestamp line
   almost 80 characters long.  Very occasionally the first line of the message
   would be too long and would overflow onto the next line, and when the file
   was later read back in the program would <a href="../B/barf.html"><i class="glossterm">barf</i></a>.  The
   length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the
   length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed, and so
   the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon!</p><p>The first paper edition of the Jargon File (Steele-1983) included an
   example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug, but the
   typesetter &#8216;corrected&#8217; it.  This has since been described as
   the phase-of-the-moon-bug bug.</p><p>However, beware of assumptions.  A few years ago, engineers of CERN
   (European Center for Nuclear Research) were baffled by some errors in
   experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator.  As the formidable
   amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers
   before being seen by humans, many people suggested the software was somehow
   sensitive to the phase of the moon.  A few desperate engineers discovered
   the truth; the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the
   geometry of the 27km circumference ring, physically caused by the
   deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon!  This story has
   entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and
   as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to
   the most modern science.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="phase.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="phase-wrapping.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">phase </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> phase-wrapping</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
