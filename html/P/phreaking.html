   there was a gentleman's agreement that phreaking as an intellectual game
   and a form of exploration was OK, but serious theft of services was taboo.
   There was significant crossover between the hacker community and the
   hard-core phone phreaks who ran semi-underground networks of their own
   through such media as the legendary <i class="citetitle">TAP Newsletter</i>.
   This ethos began to break down in the mid-1980s as wider dissemination of
   the techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks.  Around
   the same time, changes in the phone network made old-style technical
   ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it, so phreaking came to
   depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phone-card numbers.
   The crimes and punishments of gangs like the &#8216;414 group&#8217; turned
   that game very ugly.  A few old-time hackers still phreak casually just to
   keep their hand in, but most these days have hardly even heard of
   &#8216;blue boxes&#8217; or any of the other paraphernalia of the great
   phreaks of yore.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="phreaker.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pico-.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">phreaker </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> pico-</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
