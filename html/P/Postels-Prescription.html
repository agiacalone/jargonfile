   especially 1122 and 791 contain a piece of advice due to Jon Postel, 
   which is most often stated as:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you
   send.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote></div><p>That is, a well-engineered implementation of any of the
   Internet protocols should be willing to deal with marginal
   and imperfectly-formed inputs, but should not assume that the
   program on the other end (that is, the program dealing with the
   well-engineered implementation's output) will be anything other
   than rigid and inflexible, and perhaps even incomplete or downright
   buggy.</p><p>This property is valuable because a network of programs adhering
   to it will be much more robust in the presence of any uncertainties
   in the protocol specifications, or any individual implementor's
   failure to understand those specifications perfectly.  Though the
   policy does tend to accommodate broken implementations it is held
   to more important to get the communication flowing than to
   immediately (but terminally) diagnose the broken implementations
   at the expense of the people trying to use them.</p><p>The principle is a well-known one in the design of programs
   that handle Internet wire protocols, especially network
   relays and servers, and it is regularly applied by extension
   in any situation where two or more separately-implemented
   pieces of software are supposed to interoperate even though the
   various implementors have never talked to each other and have
   absolutely nothing whatsoever in common other than having
   all read the same protocol specification.  The principle travels
   under several different names, including &#8220;<span class="quote">the Internet credo</span>&#8221;,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">the IETF maxim</span>&#8221;, &#8220;<span class="quote">the Internet Engineering
   Principle</span>&#8221;, and
   &#8220;<span class="quote">the liberal/conservative rule</span>&#8221;; the [proposed] term
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Postel' Prescription</span>&#8221; is a tribute to its inventor, the first
   RFC editor
   and (until his untimely death) probably the single most respected
   individual in the Internet engineering community.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="postcardware.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="posting.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">postcardware </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> posting</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
