[scientific computation] Used of a data set that is grossly
   atypical of normal expected input, esp. one that exposes a weakness or bug
   in whatever algorithm one is using.  An algorithm that can be broken by
   pathological inputs may still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely to
   occur in practice.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. When used of test input, implies that it was purposefully
   engineered as a worst case.  The implication in both senses is that the
   data is spectacularly ill-conditioned or that someone had to explicitly set
   out to break the algorithm in order to come up with such a crazy example.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 3. Also said of an unlikely collection of circumstances.  &#8220;<span class="quote">If
   the network is down and comes up halfway through the execution of that
   command by root, the system may just crash.</span>&#8221; &#8220;<span class="quote">Yes, but that's
   a pathological case.</span>&#8221; Often used to dismiss the case from
   discussion, with the implication that the consequences are acceptable,
   since they will happen so infrequently (if at all) that it doesn't seem
   worth going to the extra trouble to handle that case (see sense 1).</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="path.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="payware.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">path </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> payware</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
