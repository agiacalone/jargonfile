Slang term for a small network message (ICMP ECHO) sent by a
   computer to check for the presence and alertness of another.  The Unix
   command
   <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ping</span>(8)</span>
   can be used to do this manually (note that

   author denies the widespread folk etymology that the name was ever intended
   as an acronym for &#8216;Packet INternet Groper&#8217;).  Occasionally used
   as a phone greeting.  See <a href="../A/ACK.html"><i class="glossterm">ACK</i></a>, also

   happiness.  People who are very happy tend to exude pings; furthermore, one
   can intentionally create pings and aim them at a needy party (e.g., a
   depressed person).  This sense of ping may appear as an exclamation;
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Ping!</span>&#8221; (I'm happy; I am emitting a quantum of happiness; I
   have been struck by a quantum of happiness).  The form
   &#8220;<span class="quote">pingfulness</span>&#8221;, which is used to describe people who exude
   pings, also occurs.  (In the standard abuse of language,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">pingfulness</span>&#8221; can also be used as an exclamation, in which
   case it's a much stronger exclamation than just &#8220;<span class="quote">ping</span>&#8221;!).

described</a> in January 1991 by Steve Hayman on the Usenet group
<tt class="systemitem">comp.sys.next</tt>.  He was trying to
isolate a faulty cable segment on a TCP/IP Ethernet hooked up to a NeXT
machine, and got tired of having to run back to his console after each cabling
tweak to see if the ping packets were getting through.  So he used the
sound-recording feature on the NeXT, then wrote a script that repeatedly
invoked
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ping</span>(8)</span>,
listened for an echo, and played back the recording on each returned packet.
Result?  A program that caused the machine to repeat, over and over,
&#8220;<span class="quote">Ping ... ping ... ping ...</span>&#8221; as long as the
network was up.  He turned the volume to maximum, ferreted through the
building with one ear cocked, and found a faulty tee connector in no
time.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pilot-error.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../P.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Ping-O--Death.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">pilot error </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Ping O' Death</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
