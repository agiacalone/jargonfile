are determinedly anti-physical.  Among those who do, interest in spectator
sports is low to non-existent; sports are something one
<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span>, not something one watches on TV.</p><p>Further, hackers avoid most team sports like the plague.  Volleyball was
long a notable exception, perhaps because it's non-contact and relatively
friendly; Ultimate Frisbee has become quite popular for similar reasons.
Hacker sports are almost always primarily self-competitive ones involving
concentration, stamina, and micromotor skills: martial arts, bicycling, auto
racing, kite flying, hiking, rock climbing, aviation, target-shooting,
sailing, caving, juggling, skiing, skating, skydiving, scuba diving.  Hackers'
delight in techno-toys also tends to draw them towards hobbies with nifty
complicated equipment that they can tinker with.</p><p>The popularity of martial arts in the hacker culture deserves special
mention.  Many observers have noted it, and the connection has grown
noticeably stronger over time.  In the 1970s, many hackers admired martial
arts disciplines from a distance, sensing a compatible ideal in their
exaltation of skill through rigorous self-discipline and concentration.  As
martial arts became increasingly mainstreamed in the U.S. and other western
countries, hackers moved from admiring to doing in large numbers.  In 1997,
for example, your humble editor recalls sitting down with five strangers at
the first Perl conference and discovering that four of us were in active
training in some sort of martial art — and, what is more interesting,
nobody at the table found this high perecentage at all odd.</p><p>Today (2000), martial arts seems to have become firmly established as
the hacker exercise form of choice, and the martial-arts culture combining
skill-centered elitism with a willingness to let anybody join seems a stronger
parallel to hacker behavior than ever.  Common usages in hacker slang
un-ironically analogize programming to kung fu (thus, one hears talk of
“<span class="quote">code-fu</span>” or in reference to specific skills like
“<span class="quote">HTML-fu</span>”).  Albeit with slightly more irony, today's hackers
readily analogize assimilation into the hacker culture with the plot of a Jet
Li movie: the aspiring newbie studies with masters of the tradition, develops
his art through deep meditation, ventures forth to perform heroic feats of
hacking, and eventually becomes a master who trains the next generation of
newbies in the hacker way.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="other-interests.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="appendixb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="education.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Other Interests </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Education</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
