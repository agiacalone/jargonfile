However, the percentage of women
is clearly higher than the low-single-digit range typical for technical
professions, and female hackers are generally respected and dealt with as
equals.</p><p>In the U.S., hackerdom is predominantly Caucasian with strong minorities
of Jews (East Coast) and Orientals (West Coast).  The Jewish contingent has
exerted a particularly pervasive cultural influence (see <a href="food.html" title="Food">Food</a>, above, and note that several common jargon terms
are obviously mutated Yiddish).</p><p>The ethnic distribution of hackers is understood by them to be a
function of which ethnic groups tend to seek and value education.  Racial and
ethnic prejudice is notably uncommon and tends to be met with freezing
contempt.</p><p>When asked, hackers often ascribe their culture's gender- and
color-blindness to a positive effect of text-only network channels, and this
is doubtless a powerful influence.  Also, the ties many hackers have to AI
research and SF literature may have helped them to develop an idea of
personhood that is inclusive rather than exclusive — after all, if one's
imagination readily grants full human rights to future AI programs, robots,
dolphins, and extraterrestrial aliens, mere color and gender can't seem very
important any more.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="politics.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="appendixb.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="religion.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Politics </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Religion</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
