   for a humanoid robot of essentially biological (as opposed to
   mechanical/electronic) construction] A person (esp. a low-level bureaucrat
   or service-business employee) exhibiting most of the following
   characteristics: (a) naive trust in the wisdom of the parent organization
   or &#8216;the system&#8217;; (b) a blind-faith propensity to believe
   obvious nonsense emitted by authority figures (or computers!); (c) a
   rule-governed mentality, one unwilling or unable to look beyond the
   &#8216;letter of the law&#8217; in exceptional situations; (d) a paralyzing
   fear of official reprimand or worse if Procedures are not followed No
   Matter What; and (e) no interest in doing anything above or beyond the call
   of a very narrowly-interpreted duty, or in particular in fixing that which
   is broken; an &#8220;<span class="quote">It's not my job, man</span>&#8221; attitude.</p><p>Typical droid positions include supermarket checkout assistant and
   bank clerk; the syndrome is also endemic in low-level government employees.
   The implication is that the rules and official procedures constitute
   software that the droid is executing; problems arise when the software has
   not been properly debugged.  The term <span class="firstterm">droid
   mentality</span> is also used to describe the mindset behind this
   behavior. Compare <a href="../S/suit.html"><i class="glossterm">suit</i></a>,
   <a href="../M/marketroid.html"><i class="glossterm">marketroid</i></a>; see <a href="../O/suffix-oid.html"><i class="glossterm">-oid</i></a>.</p><p>In England there is equivalent mainstream slang; a
   &#8216;jobsworth&#8217; is an obstructive, rule-following bureaucrat, often
   of the uniformed or suited variety.  Named for the habit of denying a
   reasonable request by sucking his teeth and saying &#8220;<span class="quote">Oh no, guv, sorry
   I can't help you: that's more than my job's worth</span>&#8221;.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="driver.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="drone.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">driver </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> drone</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
