   (including ASR-33 teletypes and PRIME minicomputers) that results in all
   characters having their high (0x80) bit forced on.  This of course makes
   transporting files to other systems much more difficult, not to mention the
   problems these machines have talking with true 8-bit devices.</p></dd><dd><p>This term was originally used specifically of PRIME (a.k.a.  PR1ME)
   minicomputers.  Folklore has it that PRIME adopted the reversed-8-bit
   convention in order to save 25 cents per serial line per machine; PRIME
   old-timers, on the other hand, claim they inherited the disease from
   Honeywell via customer NASA's compatibility requirements and struggled
   heroically to cure it.  Whoever was responsible, this probably qualifies as
   one of the most <a href="../C/cretinous.html"><i class="glossterm">cretinous</i></a> design tradeoffs ever
   made.
