[now obs.] A security or <a href="../C/copy-protection.html"><i class="glossterm">copy protection</i></a>
   device for proprietary software consisting of a serialized EPROM and some
   drivers in a D-25 connector shell, which must be connected to an I/O port
   of the computer while the program is run.  Programs that use a dongle query
   the port at startup and at programmed intervals thereafter, and terminate
   if it does not respond with the dongle's programmed validation code.  Thus,
   users can make as many copies of the program as they want but must pay for
   each dongle.  The first sighting of a dongle was in 1984, associated with a
   software product called PaperClip.  The idea was clever, but it was
   initially a failure, as users disliked tying up a serial port this way. By
   1993, dongles would typically pass data through the port and monitor for
   <a href="../M/magic.html"><i class="glossterm">magic</i></a> codes (and combinations of status lines) with
   minimal if any interference with devices further down the line &#8212; this
   innovation was necessary to allow daisy-chained dongles for multiple pieces
   of software.  These devices have become rare as the industry has moved away
   from copy-protection schemes in general.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. By extension, any physical electronic key or transferable ID
   required for a program to function.  Common variations on this theme have
   used parallel or even joystick ports.  See
   <a href="dongle-disk.html"><i class="glossterm">dongle-disk</i></a>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. An adaptor cable mating a special edge-type connector on a PCMCIA
   or on-board Ethernet card to a standard 8p8c Ethernet jack.  This usage
   seems to have surfaced in 1999 and is now dominant.  Laptop owners curse
   these things because they're notoriously easy to lose and the vendors
   commonly charge extortionate prices for replacements.</p></dd><dd><p>[Note: in early 1992, advertising copy from Rainbow Technologies (a
   manufacturer of dongles) included a claim that the word derived from
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Don Gall</span>&#8221;, allegedly the inventor of the device.  The
   company's receptionist will cheerfully tell you that the story is a myth
   invented for the ad copy.  Nevertheless, I expect it to haunt my life as a
   lexicographer for at least the next ten years. :-( &#8212;ESR]</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Don-t-do-that-then-.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="dongle-disk.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Don't do that then! </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> dongle-disk</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
