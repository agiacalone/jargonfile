   errors, so it was somewhat idiosyncratic to his style, and would often make
   hash of anyone else's typos if they were stylistically different.  Some
   victims of DWIM thus claimed that the acronym stood for &#8216;Damn
   Warren&#8217;s Infernal Machine!'.</p><p>In one notorious incident, Warren added a DWIM feature to the command
   interpreter used at Xerox PARC.  One day another hacker there typed
   <b class="command">delete *$</b> to free up some disk space.  (The
   editor there named backup files by appending <b class="command">$</b> to the original file name, so he was trying to
   delete any backup files left over from old editing sessions.)  It happened
   that there weren't any editor backup files, so DWIM helpfully reported
   <b class="command">*$ not found, assuming you meant 'delete
   *'.</b> It then started to delete all the files on the disk!  The
   hacker managed to stop it with a <a href="../V/Vulcan-nerve-pinch.html"><i class="glossterm">Vulcan nerve pinch</i></a>
   after only a half dozen or so files were lost.</p><p>The disgruntled victim later said he had been sorely tempted to go to
   Warren's office, tie Warren down in his chair in front of his workstation,
   and then type <b class="command">delete *$</b> twice.</p><p>DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex
   program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the
   ideal computer would have.  Back when proofs of program correctness were in
   vogue, there were also jokes about <span class="firstterm">DWIMC</span> (Do What I Mean, Correctly).  A related
   term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The Right Thing); see
   <a href="../R/Right-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Right Thing</i></a>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="dusty-deck.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="dynner.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">dusty deck </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> dynner</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
