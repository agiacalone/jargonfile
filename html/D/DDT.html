</p></dd><dd><p> 1. Generic term for a program that assists in debugging other
   programs by showing individual machine instructions in a readable symbolic
   form and letting the user change them.  In this sense the term DDT is now
   archaic, having been widely displaced by <span class="firstterm">debugger</span> or names of individual programs like
   <b class="command">adb</b>, <b class="command">sdb</b>,
   <b class="command">dbx</b>, or <b class="command">gdb</b>.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. [ITS] Under MIT's fabled <a href="../I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a> operating
   system, DDT (running under the alias HACTRN, a six-letterism for
   &#8216;Hack Translator&#8217;) was also used as the
   <a href="../S/shell.html"><i class="glossterm">shell</i></a> or top level command language used to execute
   other programs.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. Any one of several specific DDTs (sense 1) supported on early
   <a href="DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a> hardware and CP/M.  The PDP-10 Reference
   Handbook (1969) contained a footnote on the first page of the documentation
   for DDT that illuminates the origin of the term:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Historical footnote: DDT was developed at MIT for the PDP-1
computer in 1961.  At that time DDT stood for &#8220;<span class="quote">DEC Debugging
Tape</span>&#8221;.  Since then, the idea of an on-line debugging program has
propagated throughout the computer industry.  DDT programs are now
available for all DEC computers.  Since media other than tape are
now frequently used, the more descriptive name &#8220;<span class="quote">Dynamic Debugging
Technique</span>&#8221; has been adopted, retaining the DDT abbreviation.  Confusion
between DDT-10 and another well known pesticide,
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane 
C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>9</sub>Cl<sub>5</sub>
should be minimal since each attacks a
different, and apparently mutually exclusive, class of bugs.</p></blockquote></div><p>(The &#8216;tape&#8217; referred to was, incidentally, not magnetic
   but paper.)  Sadly, this quotation was removed from later editions of the
   handbook after the <a href="../S/suit.html"><i class="glossterm">suit</i></a>s took over and
   <a href="DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a> became much more
   &#8216;businesslike&#8217;.</p><p>The history above is known to many old-time hackers.  But there's
   more: Peter Samson, compiler of the original <a href="../T/TMRC.html"><i class="glossterm">TMRC</i></a>
   lexicon, reports that he named <span class="firstterm">DDT</span>
   after a similar tool on the TX-0 computer, the direct ancestor of the PDP-1
   built at MIT's Lincoln Lab in 1957.  The debugger on that ground-breaking
   machine (the first transistorized computer) rejoiced in the name FLIT
   (FLexowriter Interrogation Tape).  Flit was for many years the trade-name
   of a popular insecticide.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="dd.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="de-rezz.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">dd </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> de-rezz</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
