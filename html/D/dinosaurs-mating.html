   merger or buyout occurs; originally reflected a perception by hackers that
   these signal another stage in the long, slow dying of the
   <a href="../M/mainframe.html"><i class="glossterm">mainframe</i></a> industry.  In the mainframe industry's
   glory days of the 1960s, it was &#8216;IBM and the Seven Dwarfs&#8217;:
   Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and Univac.
   RCA and GE sold out early, and it was &#8216;IBM and the Bunch&#8217;
   (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell) for a while.
   Honeywell was bought out by Bull; Burroughs merged with Univac to form
   Unisys (in 1984 &#8212; this was when the phrase <span class="firstterm">dinosaurs mating</span> was coined); and in 1991
   AT&amp;T absorbed NCR (but spat it back out a few years later). Control
   Data still exists but is no longer in the mainframe business.  In similar
   wave of dinosaur-matings as the PC business began to consolidate after
   1995, Digital Equipment was bought by Compaq which was bought by
   Hewlett-Packard.  More such earth-shaking unions of doomed giants seem
   inevitable.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="dinosaur-pen.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="dirtball.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">dinosaur pen </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> dirtball</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
