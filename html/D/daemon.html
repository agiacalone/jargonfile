   And Execution MONitor&#8217;] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but
   lies dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that the
   perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is lurking
   (though often a program will commit an action only because it knows that it
   will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example, under
   <a href="../I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a>, writing a file on the LPT spooler's directory
   would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.  The
   advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files printed need
   neither compete for access to nor understand any idiosyncrasies of the LPT.
   They simply enter their implicit requests and let the daemon decide what to
   do with them.  Daemons are usually spawned automatically by the system, and
   may either live forever or be regenerated at intervals.</p></dd><dd><p>Daemon and <a href="demon.html"><i class="glossterm">demon</i></a> are often used
   interchangeably, but seem to have distinct connotations.  The term
   <span class="firstterm">daemon</span> was introduced to computing by
   <a href="../C/CTSS.html"><i class="glossterm">CTSS</i></a> people (who pronounced it <span class="pronunciation">/dee´mon/</span>) and used it to refer to
   what ITS called a <a href="dragon.html"><i class="glossterm">dragon</i></a>; the prototype was a
   program called DAEMON that automatically made tape backups of the file
   system.  Although the meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think
   this glossary reflects current (2003) usage.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="../D.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../D.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="daemon-book.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">D </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> daemon book</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
