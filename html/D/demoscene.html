   located primarily in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Demoscene folklore
   recounts that when old-time <a href="../W/warez-d00dz.html"><i class="glossterm">warez d00dz</i></a> cracked some
   piece of software they often added an advertisement in the beginning,
   usually containing colorful <a href="display-hack.html"><i class="glossterm">display hack</i></a>s with
   greetings to other cracking groups.  The demoscene was born among people
   who decided building these display hacks is more interesting than hacking
   &#8212; or anyway safer.  Around 1990 there began to be very serious police
   pressure on cracking groups, including raids with SWAT teams crashing into
   bedrooms to confiscate computers.  Whether in response to this or for
   esthetic reasons, crackers of that period began to build self-contained
   display hacks of considerable elaboration and beauty (within the culture
   such a hack is called a <a href="demo.html"><i class="glossterm">demo</i></a>).  As more of these
   <a href="demogroup.html"><i class="glossterm">demogroup</i></a>s emerged, they started to have
   <a href="../C/compo.html"><i class="glossterm">compo</i></a>s at copying parties (see
   <a href="../C/copyparty.html"><i class="glossterm">copyparty</i></a>), which later evolved to standalone events
   (see <a href="demoparty.html"><i class="glossterm">demoparty</i></a>).  The demoscene has retained some
   traits from the <a href="../W/warez-d00dz.html"><i class="glossterm">warez d00dz</i></a>, including their style
   of handles and group names and some of their jargon.</p><p>Traditionally demos were written in assembly language, with lots of
   smart tricks, self-modifying code, undocumented op-codes and the like.
   Some time around 1995, people started coding demos in C, and a couple of
   years after that, they also started using Java.</p><p>Ten years on (in 1998-1999), the demoscene is changing as its
   original platforms (C64, Amiga, Spectrum, Atari ST, IBM PC under DOS) die
   out and activity shifts towards Windows, Linux, and the Internet.  While
   deeply underground in the past, demoscene is trying to get into the
   mainstream as accepted art form, and one symptom of this is the
   commercialization of bigger demoparties. Older demosceners frown at this,
   but the majority think it's a good direction.  Many demosceners end up
   working in the computer game industry.  Demoscene resource pages are
