   starting about 1991. The pronunciation <span class="pronunciation">/li´nuhks/</span> is preferred because the
   name &#8216;Linus&#8217; has an <span class="pronunciation">/ee/</span> sound in Swedish (Linus's family is
   part of Finland's 6% ethnic-Swedish minority) and Linus considers English
   short <span class="pronunciation">/i/</span> to be closer to
   <span class="pronunciation">/ee/</span> than English long <span class="pronunciation">/i:/</span>.  This may be the most remarkable
   hacker project in history &#8212; an entire clone of Unix for 386, 486 and
   Pentium micros, distributed for free with sources over the net (ports to
   Alpha and Sparc and many other machines are also in use).</p><p>Linux is what <a href="../G/GNU.html"><i class="glossterm">GNU</i></a> aimed to be, and it relies
   on the GNU toolset.  But the Free Software Foundation didn't produce the
   kernel to go with that toolset until 1999, which was too late.  Other,
   similar efforts like FreeBSD and NetBSD have been technically successful
   but never caught fire the way Linux has; as this is written in 2003, Linux
   has effectively swallowed all proprietary Unixes except Solaris and is
   seriously challenging Microsoft. It has already captured 41% of the
   Internet-server market and over 25% of general business servers.</p><p>An earlier version of this entry opined &#8220;<span class="quote">The secret of Linux's
   success seems to be that Linus worked much harder early on to keep the
   development process open and recruit other hackers, creating a snowball
   effect.</span>&#8221; Truer than we knew.  See
   <a href="../B/bazaar.html"><i class="glossterm">bazaar</i></a>.</p><p>(Some people object that the name &#8216;Linux&#8217; should be used
   to refer only to the kernel, not the entire operating system.  This claim
   is a proxy for an underlying territorial dispute; people who insist on the
   term <span class="firstterm">GNU/Linux</span> want the
   <a href="../F/FSF.html"><i class="glossterm">FSF</i></a> to get most of the credit for Linux because RMS
   and friends wrote many of its user-level tools.  Neither this theory nor
   the term <span class="firstterm">GNU/Linux</span> has gained more
   than minority acceptance).</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Linus.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../L.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="lion-food.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Linus </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> lion food</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
