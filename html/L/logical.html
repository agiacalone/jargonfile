   &#8216;logical&#8217; name] Having the role of.  If a person (say, Les
   Earnest at SAIL) who had long held a certain post left and were replaced,

   judgment on the replacement.)  Compare
   <a href="../V/virtual.html"><i class="glossterm">virtual</i></a>.</p><p>At Stanford, &#8216;logical&#8217; compass directions denote a
   coordinate system relative to El Camino Real, in which &#8216;logical
   north&#8217; is always toward San Francisco and &#8216;logical south&#8217;
   is always toward San Jose--in spite of the fact that El Camino Real runs
   physical north/south near San Francisco, physical east/west near San Jose,
   and along a curve everywhere in between. (The best rule of thumb here is
   that, by definition, El Camino Real always runs logical
   north-south.)</p><p>In giving directions, one might say: &#8220;<span class="quote">To get to Rincon Tarasco
   restaurant, get onto <a href="../E/El-Camino-Bignum.html"><i class="glossterm">El Camino Bignum</i></a> going logical
   north.</span>&#8221; Using the word &#8216;logical&#8217; helps to prevent the
   recipient from worrying about that the fact that the sun is setting almost
   directly in front of him.  The concept is reinforced by North American
   highways which are almost, but not quite, consistently labeled with logical
   rather than physical directions.  A similar situation exists at MIT: Route
   128 (famous for the electronics industry that grew up along it) wraps
   roughly 3 quarters around Boston at a radius of 10 miles, terminating near
   the coastline at each end.  It would be most precise to describe the two
   directions along this highway as &#8216;clockwise&#8217; and
   &#8216;counterclockwise&#8217;, but the road signs all say
   &#8220;<span class="quote">north</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="quote">south</span>&#8221;, respectively.  A hacker
   might describe these directions as <span class="firstterm">logical
   north</span> and <span class="firstterm">logical south</span>,
   to indicate that they are conventional directions not corresponding to the
   usual denotation for those words.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="logic-bomb.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../L.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="loop-through.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">logic bomb </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> loop through</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
