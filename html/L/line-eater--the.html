[Usenet] A bug in some now-obsolete versions of the netnews
   software that used to eat up to BUFSIZ bytes of the article text.  The bug
   was triggered by having the text of the article start with a space or tab.
   This bug was quickly personified as a mythical creature called the
   <span class="firstterm">line eater</span>, and postings often
   included a dummy line of <span class="firstterm">line eater
   food</span>.  Ironically, line eater &#8216;food&#8217; not beginning
   with a space or tab wasn't actually eaten, since the bug was avoided; but
   if there <span class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> a space or tab before it, then the line
   eater would eat the food <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the beginning of the text
   it was supposed to be protecting.  The practice of <span class="firstterm">sacrificing to the line eater</span> continued for
   some time after the bug had been <a href="../N/nailed-to-the-wall.html"><i class="glossterm">nailed to the wall</i></a>,
   and is still humorously referred to.  The bug itself was still occasionally
   reported to be lurking in some mail-to-netnews gateways as late as 1991.
