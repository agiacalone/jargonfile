Synonym for <a href="luser.html"><i class="glossterm">luser</i></a>, not used much by
   hackers but common among <a href="../W/warez-d00dz.html"><i class="glossterm">warez d00dz</i></a>, crackers, and
   <a href="../P/phreaker.html"><i class="glossterm">phreaker</i></a>s.  A person who downloads much, but who
   never uploads. (Also known as <span class="firstterm">leecher</span>).  Oppose <a href="../E/elite.html"><i class="glossterm">elite</i></a>.
   Has the same connotations of self-conscious elitism that use of
   <a href="luser.html"><i class="glossterm">luser</i></a> does among hackers.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. Someone who tries to crack a BBS.  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. Someone who annoys the sysop or other BBS users &#8212; for instance,
   by posting lots of silly messages, uploading virus-ridden software,
   frequently dropping carrier, etc.</p><p>Crackers also use it to refer to cracker
   <a href="../W/wannabee.html"><i class="glossterm">wannabee</i></a>s. In phreak culture, a lamer is one who
   scams codes off others rather than doing cracks or really understanding the
   fundamental concepts.  In <a href="../W/warez-d00dz.html"><i class="glossterm">warez d00dz</i></a> culture, where
   the ability to wave around cracked commercial software within days of (or
   before) release to the commercial market is much esteemed, the lamer might
   try to upload garbage or shareware or something incredibly old (old in this
   context is read as a few years to anything older than 3 days).
   &#8216;Lamer&#8217; is also much used in the IRC world in a similar sense
   to the above.</p></dd><dd><p>This term seems to have originated in the Commodore-64 scene in the
   mid 1980s.  It was popularized among Amiga crackers of the mid-1980s by
   &#8216;Lamer Exterminator&#8217;, the most famous and feared Amiga virus
   ever, which gradually corrupted non-write-protected floppy disks with bad
   sectors. The bad sectors, when looked at, were overwritten with repetitions
   of the string &#8220;<span class="quote">LAMER!</span>&#8221;.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="lag.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../L.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="LAN-party.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">lag </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> LAN party</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
