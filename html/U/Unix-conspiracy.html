   <a href="../I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a> and <a href="../T/TOPS-20.html"><i class="glossterm">TOPS-20</i></a> fans, Unix's
   growth is the result of a plot, hatched during the 1970s at Bell Labs,
   whose intent was to hobble AT&amp;T's competitors by making them dependent
   upon a system whose future evolution was to be under AT&amp;T's control.
   This would be accomplished by disseminating an operating system that is
   apparently inexpensive and easily portable, but also relatively unreliable
   and insecure (so as to require continuing upgrades from AT&amp;T).  This
   theory was lent a substantial impetus in 1984 by the paper referenced in
   the <a href="../B/back-door.html"><i class="glossterm">back door</i></a> entry.</p><p>In this view, Unix was designed to be one of the first computer
   viruses (see <a href="../V/virus.html"><i class="glossterm">virus</i></a>) &#8212; but a virus spread to
   computers indirectly by people and market forces, rather than directly
   through disks and networks.  Adherents of this &#8216;Unix virus&#8217;
   theory like to cite the fact that the well-known quotation &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix is
   snake oil</span>&#8221; was uttered by <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a> president
   Kenneth Olsen shortly before DEC began actively promoting its own family of
   Unix workstations.  (Olsen now claims to have been misquoted.)</p><p>If there was ever such a conspiracy, it got thoroughly out of the
   plotters' control after 1990.  AT&amp;T sold its Unix operation to Novell
   around the same time <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a> and other free-Unix
   distributions were beginning to make noise.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Unix-brain-damage.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../U.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Unix-weenie.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Unix brain damage </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Unix weenie</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
