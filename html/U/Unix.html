   early on it was &#8220;<span class="quote">UNICS</span>&#8221;] (also &#8220;<span class="quote">UNIX</span>&#8221;) An
   interactive timesharing system invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell
   Labs left the Multics project, originally so he could play games on his
   scavenged PDP-7.  Dennis Ritchie, the inventor of C, is considered a
   co-author of the system.  The turning point in Unix's history came when it
   was reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972&#8212;1974, making it
   the first source-portable OS.  Unix subsequently underwent mutations and
   expansions at the hands of many different people, resulting in a uniquely
   flexible and developer-friendly environment.  By 1991, Unix had become the
   most widely used multiuser general-purpose operating system in the world
   &#8212; and since 1996 the variant called <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a> has
   been at the cutting edge of the <a href="../O/open-source.html"><i class="glossterm">open source</i></a>
   movement.  Many people consider the success of Unix the most important
   victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but see <a href="Unix-weenie.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix
   weenie</i></a> and <a href="Unix-conspiracy.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix conspiracy</i></a> for an
   opposing point of view).  See <a href="../V/Version-7.html"><i class="glossterm">Version 7</i></a>,
   <a href="../B/BSD.html"><i class="glossterm">BSD</i></a>, <a href="../L/Linux.html"><i class="glossterm">Linux</i></a>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="ritchiethompson"/><img src="../graphics/richiethompson.jpg"/><div class="caption"><p>Archetypal hackers ken (left) and dmr (right).</p></div></div><p>Some people are confused over whether this word is appropriately
   &#8216;UNIX&#8217; or &#8216;Unix&#8217;; both forms are common, and used
   interchangeably.  Dennis Ritchie says that the &#8216;UNIX&#8217; spelling
   originally happened in CACM's 1974 paper <i class="citetitle">The UNIX Time-Sharing
   System</i> because &#8220;<span class="quote">we had a new typesetter and
   <a href="../T/troff.html"><i class="glossterm">troff</i></a> had just been invented and we were intoxicated
   by being able to produce small caps.</span>&#8221; Later, dmr tried to get the
   spelling changed to &#8216;Unix&#8217; in a couple of Bell Labs papers, on
   the grounds that the word is not acronymic.  He failed, and eventually (his
   words) &#8220;<span class="quote">wimped out</span>&#8221; on the issue.  So, while the trademark
   today is &#8216;UNIX&#8217;, both capitalizations are grounded in ancient
   usage; the Jargon File uses &#8216;Unix&#8217; in deference to dmr's
   wishes.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="uninteresting.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../U.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Unix-brain-damage.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">uninteresting </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Unix brain damage</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
