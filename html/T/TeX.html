   formatter written by Donald E. <a href="../K/Knuth.html"><i class="glossterm">Knuth</i></a>, very popular
   in the computer-science community (it is good enough to have displaced Unix
   <a href="troff.html"><i class="glossterm">troff</i></a>, the other favored formatter, even at many
   Unix installations).  TeX fans insist on the correct (guttural)
   pronunciation, and the correct spelling (all caps, squished together, with
   the E depressed below the baseline; the mixed-case &#8216;TeX&#8217; is
   considered an acceptable kluge on ASCII-only devices).  Fans like to
   proliferate names from the word &#8216;TeX&#8217; &#8212; such as TeXnician
   (TeX user), TeXhacker (TeX programmer), TeXmaster (competent TeX
   programmer), TeXhax, and TeXnique.  See also
   <a href="../C/CrApTeX.html"><i class="glossterm">CrApTeX</i></a>.</p><p>Knuth began TeX because he had become annoyed at the declining
   quality of the typesetting in volumes I--III of his monumental
   <i class="citetitle">Art of Computer Programming</i> (see
   <a href="../K/Knuth.html"><i class="glossterm">Knuth</i></a>, also <a href="../B/bible.html"><i class="glossterm">bible</i></a>).  In a
   manifestation of the typical hackish urge to solve the problem at hand once
   and for all, he began to design his own typesetting language.  He thought
   he would finish it on his sabbatical in 1978; he was wrong by only about 8
   years.  The language was finally frozen around 1985, but volume IV of
   <i class="citetitle">The Art of Computer Programming</i> is not expected to
   appear until 2007.  The impact and influence of TeX's design has been such
   that nobody minds this very much.  Many grand hackish projects have started
   as a bit of <a href="toolsmith.html"><i class="glossterm">toolsmith</i></a>ing on the way to something
   else; Knuth's diversion was simply on a grander scale than most.</p><p>TeX has also been a noteworthy example of free, shared, but
   high-quality software.  Knuth offers a monetary award to anyone who found
   and reported bugs dating from before the 1989 code freeze; as the years
   wore on and the few remaining bugs were fixed (and new ones even harder to
   find), the bribe went up.  Though well-written, TeX is so large (and so
   full of cutting edge technique) that it is said to have unearthed at least
   one bug in every Pascal system it has been compiled with.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="test.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../T.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="text.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">test </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> text</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
