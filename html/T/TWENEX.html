   the second proprietary OS for the PDP-10 &#8212; preferred by most PDP-10
   hackers over TOPS-10 (that is, by those who were not
   <a href="../I/ITS.html"><i class="glossterm">ITS</i></a> or <a href="../W/WAITS.html"><i class="glossterm">WAITS</i></a> partisans).
   TOPS-20 began in 1969 as Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman's TENEX operating
   system using special paging hardware.  By the early 1970s, almost all of
   the systems on the ARPANET ran TENEX.  DEC purchased the rights to TENEX
   from BBN and began work to make it their own.  The first in-house code name
   for the operating system was VIROS (VIRtual memory Operating System); when
   customers started asking questions, the name was changed to SNARK so DEC
   could truthfully deny that there was any project called VIROS.  When the
   name SNARK became known, the name was briefly reversed to become KRANS;
   this was quickly abandoned when someone objected that <span class="firstterm">krans</span> meant &#8216;funeral wreath&#8217; in
   Swedish (though some Swedish speakers have since said it means simply
   &#8216;wreath&#8217;; this part of the story may be apocryphal).
   Ultimately DEC picked TOPS-20 as the name of the operating system, and it
   was as TOPS-20 that it was marketed.  The hacker community, mindful of its
   origins, quickly dubbed it TWENEX (a contraction of &#8216;twenty
   TENEX&#8217;), even though by this point very little of the original TENEX
   code remained (analogously to the differences between AT&amp;T V6 Unix and
   BSD).  DEC people cringed when they heard &#8220;<span class="quote">TWENEX</span>&#8221;, but the
   term caught on nevertheless (the written abbreviation &#8216;20x&#8217; was
   also used).  TWENEX was successful and very popular; in fact, there was a
   period in the early 1980s when it commanded as fervent a culture of
   partisans as Unix or ITS &#8212; but DEC's decision to scrap all the
   internal rivals to the <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a> architecture and its
   relatively stodgy VMS OS killed the DEC-20 and put a sad end to TWENEX's
   brief day in the sun.  DEC attempted to convince TOPS-20 users to convert
   to <a href="../V/VMS.html"><i class="glossterm">VMS</i></a>, but instead, by the late 1980s, most of the
   TOPS-20 hackers had migrated to Unix.
