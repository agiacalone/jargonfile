   a computer's time so that they are shared across multiple tasks and
   multiple users, with each user having the illusion that his or her
   computation is going on continuously.  John McCarthy, the inventor of
   <a href="../L/LISP.html"><i class="glossterm">LISP</i></a>, first <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html" target="_top">imagined
   this technique</a> in the late 1950s.  The first timesharing operating
   systems, BBN's &quot;Little Hospital&quot; and <a href="../C/CTSS.html"><i class="glossterm">CTSS</i></a>, were
   deplayed in 1962-63.  The early hacker culture of the 1960s and 1970s grew
   up around the first generation of relatively cheap timesharing computers,
   notably the <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a> 10, 11, and <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a> lines.  But these
   were only cheap in a relative sense; though quite a bit less powerful than
   today's personal computers, they had to be shared by dozens or even
   hundreds of people each.  The early hacker comunities nucleated around
   places where it was relatively easy to get access to a timesharing
   account.</p><p>Nowadays, communications bandwidth is usually the most important 
   constraint on what you can do with your computer.  Not so back then;
   timesharing machines were often loaded to capacity, and it was not uncommon 
   for everyone's work to grind to a halt while the machine scheduler
   thrashed, trying to figure out what to do next.  Early hacker slang
   was replete with terms like <span class="firstterm">cycle
   crunch</span> and <span class="firstterm">cycle drought</span>
   for describing the consequences of too few instructions-per-second spread
   among too many users.  As GLS has noted, this sort of problem influenced
   the tendency of many hackers to work odd schedules.</p><p>One reason this is worth noting here is to make the point that the
   earliest hacker communities were physical, not distributed via networks;
   they consisted of hackers who shared a machine and therefore had to deal
   with many of the same problems with respect to it.  A system crash could
   idle dozens of eager programmers, all sitting in the same terminal room and
   with little to do but talk with each other until normal operation
   resumed.</p><p>Timesharing moved from being the luxury of a few large universities
   runing semi-experimental operating systems to being more generally
   available about 1975-76. Hackers in search of more cycles and more control
   over their programming environment began to migrate off timesharing
   machines and onto what are now called <span class="firstterm">workstations</span> around 1983.  It took another ten
   years, the development of powerful 32-bit personal micros, the
   <a href="../G/Great-Internet-Explosion.html"><i class="glossterm">Great Internet Explosion</i></a> before the migration was
   complete.  It is no coincidence that the last stages of this migration
   coincided with the development of the first open-source operating
   systems.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="times-or-divided-by.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../T.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="TINC.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">times-or-divided-by </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> TINC</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
