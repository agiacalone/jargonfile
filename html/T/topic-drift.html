   tendency of a <a href="thread.html"><i class="glossterm">thread</i></a> to drift away from the original
   subject of discussion (and thus, from the Subject header of the originating
   message), or the results of that tendency.  The header in each post can be
   changed to keep current with the posts, but usually isn't due to
   forgetfulness or laziness.  A single post may often result in several posts
   each responding to a different point in the original.  Some subthreads will
   actually be in response to some off-the-cuff side comment, possibly
   degenerating into a <a href="../F/flame-war.html"><i class="glossterm">flame war</i></a>, or just as often
   evolving into a separate discussion.  Hence, discussions aren't really so
   much threads as they are trees.  Except that they don't really have leaves,
   or multiple branching roots; usually some lines of discussion will just
   sort of die off after everyone gets tired of them.  This could take
   anywhere from hours to weeks, or even longer.</p><p>The term &#8216;topic drift&#8217; is often used in gentle reminders
   that the discussion has strayed off any useful track.  &#8220;<span class="quote">I think we
