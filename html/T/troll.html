   <tt class="systemitem">alt.folklore.urban</tt>] To utter a
   posting on <a href="../U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a> designed to attract predictable
   responses or <a href="../F/flame.html"><i class="glossterm">flame</i></a>s; or, the post itself.  Derives
   from the phrase &#8220;<span class="quote">trolling for <a href="../N/newbie.html"><i class="glossterm">newbie</i></a>s</span>&#8221;
   which in turn comes from mainstream &#8220;<span class="quote">trolling</span>&#8221;, a style of
   fishing in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping for a bite.
   The well-constructed troll is a post that induces lots of newbies and
   flamers to make themselves look even more clueless than they already do,
   while subtly conveying to the more savvy and experienced that it is in fact
   a deliberate troll.  If you don't fall for the joke, you get to be in on
   it. See also <a href="../Y/YHBT.html"><i class="glossterm">YHBT</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>2. <span class="grammar">n.</span> An individual who
   chronically trolls in sense 1; regularly posts specious arguments, flames
   or personal attacks to a newsgroup, discussion list, or in email for no
   other purpose than to annoy someone or disrupt a discussion.  Trolls are
   recognizable by the fact that they have no real interest in learning about
   the topic at hand - they simply want to utter flame bait.  Like the ugly
   creatures they are named after, they exhibit no redeeming characteristics,
   and as such, they are recognized as a lower form of life on the net, as in,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Oh, ignore him, he's just a troll.</span>&#8221; Compare

   monitor. A popular campus job for CS students. Duties include helping
   newbies and ensuring that lab policies are followed. Probably so-called
   because it involves lurking in dark cavelike corners.</p></dd><dd><p>Some people claim that the troll (sense 1) is properly a narrower
   category than <a href="../F/flame-bait.html"><i class="glossterm">flame bait</i></a>, that a troll is
   categorized by containing some assertion that is wrong but not overtly
   controversial. See also <a href="Troll-O-Meter.html"><i class="glossterm">Troll-O-Meter</i></a>.</p><p>The use of &#8216;troll&#8217; in any of these senses is a live
   metaphor that readily produces elaborations and combining forms.  For
   example, one not infrequently sees the warning &#8220;<span class="quote">Do not feed the
   troll</span>&#8221; as part of a followup to troll postings.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Trojan-horse.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../T.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Troll-O-Meter.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Trojan horse </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Troll-O-Meter</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
