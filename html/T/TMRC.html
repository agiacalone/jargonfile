   hacker culture.  The 1959 <i class="citetitle">Dictionary of the TMRC
   Language</i> compiled by Peter Samson included several terms that
   became basics of the hackish vocabulary (see
   esp. <a href="../F/foo.html"><i class="glossterm">foo</i></a>, <a href="../M/mung.html"><i class="glossterm">mung</i></a>, and
   <a href="../F/frob.html"><i class="glossterm">frob</i></a>).</p><p>By 1962, TMRC's legendary layout was already a marvel of complexity
   and has grown in the years since. All the features described here were
   still present when the old layout was decommissioned in 1998 just before
   the demolition of MIT Building 20, and will almost certainly be retained
   when the old layout is rebuilt (expected in 2003).  The control system
   alone featured about 1200 relays.  There were <a href="../S/scram-switch.html"><i class="glossterm">scram
   switch</i></a>es located at numerous places around the room that could
   be thwacked if something undesirable was about to occur, such as a train
   going full-bore at an obstruction.  Another feature of the system was a
   digital clock on the dispatch board, which was itself something of a wonder
   in those bygone days before cheap LEDs and seven-segment displays.  When
   someone hit a scram switch the clock stopped and the display was replaced
   with the word &#8216;FOO&#8217;; at TMRC the scram switches are therefore
   called <span class="firstterm">foo switches</span>.</p><p>Steven Levy, in his book <i class="citetitle">Hackers</i> (see the
   <a href="../pt03.html#bibliography" title="Bibliography">Bibliography</a> in Appendix C), gives a
   stimulating account of those early years.  TMRC's Signals and Power
   Committee included many of the early PDP-1 hackers and the people who later
   became the core of the MIT AI Lab staff.  Thirty years later that
   connection is still very much alive, and this lexicon accordingly includes
   a number of entries from a recent revision of the TMRC dictionary.</p><p>TMRC has a web page at <a href="http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/" target="_top">http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/</a>.  The TMRC
   Dictionary is available there, at <a href="http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html" target="_top">http://tmrc-www.mit.edu/dictionary.html</a>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="TLA.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../T.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="TMRCie.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">TLA </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> TMRCie</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
