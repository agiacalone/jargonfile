   Gosling (and known by the name &#8220;<span class="quote">Oak</span>&#8221;) with the intention of
   being the successor to <a href="../C/C-plus-plus.html"><i class="glossterm">C++</i></a> (the project was however
   originally sold to Sun as an embedded language for use in set-top boxes).
   After the great Internet explosion of 1993-1994, Java was hacked into a
   byte-interpreted language and became the focus of a relentless hype
   campaign by Sun, which touted it as the new language of choice for
   distributed applications.</p><p>Java is indeed a stronger and cleaner design than C++ and has been
   embraced by many in the hacker community &#8212; but it has been a
   considerable source of frustration to many others, for reasons ranging from
   uneven support on different Web browser platforms, performance issues, and
   some notorious deficiencies in some of the standard toolkits (AWT in
   particular).  <a href="../M/Microsoft.html"><i class="glossterm">Microsoft</i></a>'s determined attempts to
   corrupt the language (which it rightly sees as a threat to its OS monopoly)
   have not helped.  As of 2003, these issues are still in the process of
   being resolved.</p><p>Despite many attractive features and a good design, it is difficult
   to find people willing to praise Java who have tried to implement a
   complex, real-world system with it (but to be fair it is early days yet,
   and no other language has ever been forced to spend its childhood under the
   limelight the way Java has).  On the other hand, Java has already been a
   big <a href="../W/win.html"><i class="glossterm">win</i></a> in academic circles, where it has taken the
   place of <a href="../P/Pascal.html"><i class="glossterm">Pascal</i></a> as the preferred tool for teaching
   the basics of good programming to the next generation of hackers.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="jaggies.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../J.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="JCL.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">jaggies </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> JCL</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
