   &#8216;kludge&#8217;.  Reports from <a href="../O/old-fart.html"><i class="glossterm">old fart</i></a>s are
   consistent that &#8216;kluge&#8217; was the original spelling, reported
   around computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, used
   exclusively of <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware</em></span> kluges.  In 1947, the
   <i class="citetitle">New York Folklore Quarterly</i> reported a classic
   shaggy-dog story &#8216;Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker&#8217; then current in
   the Armed Forces, in which a &#8216;kluge&#8217; was a complex and puzzling
   artifact with a trivial function.  Other sources report that
   &#8216;kluge&#8217; was common Navy slang in the WWII era for any piece of
   electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at
   sea.</p><p>However, there is reason to believe this slang use may be a decade
   older.  Several respondents have connected it to the brand name of a device
   called a &#8220;<span class="quote">Kluge paper feeder</span>&#8221;, an adjunct to mechanical
   printing presses.  Legend has it that the Kluge feeder was designed before
   small, cheap electric motors and control electronics; it relied on a
   fiendishly complex assortment of cams, belts, and linkages to both power
   and synchronize all its operations from one motive driveshaft.  It was
   accordingly temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly
   difficult to repair &#8212; but oh, so clever!  People who tell this story
   also aver that &#8216;Kluge&#8217; was the name of a design
   engineer.</p><p>There is in fact a Brandtjen &amp; Kluge Inc., an old family business
   that manufactures printing equipment &#8212; interestingly, their name is
   pronounced <span class="pronunciation">/kloo´gee/</span>!
   Henry Brandtjen, president of the firm, told me (ESR, 1994) that his
   company was co-founded by his father and an engineer named Kluge <span class="pronunciation">/kloo´gee/</span>, who built and co-designed
   the original Kluge automatic feeder in 1919.  Mr. Brandtjen claims,
   however, that this was a <span class="emphasis"><em>simple</em></span> device (with only four
   cams); he says he has no idea how the myth of its complexity took hold.
   Other correspondents differ with Mr. Brandtjen's history of the device and
   his allegation that it was a simple rather than complex one, but agree that
   the Kluge automatic feeder was the most likely source of the
   folklore.</p><p><a href="../T/TMRC.html"><i class="glossterm">TMRC</i></a> and the MIT hacker culture of the early
   '60s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used
   some WWII military slang (see also <a href="../F/foobar.html"><i class="glossterm">foobar</i></a>).  It
   seems likely that &#8216;kluge&#8217; came to MIT via alumni of the many
   military electronics projects that had been located in Cambridge (many in
   MIT's venerable Building 20, in which <a href="../T/TMRC.html"><i class="glossterm">TMRC</i></a> is also
   located) during the war.</p><p>The variant &#8216;kludge&#8217; was apparently popularized by the
   <a href="../D/Datamation.html"><i class="glossterm">Datamation</i></a> article mentioned under
   <a href="kludge.html"><i class="glossterm">kludge</i></a>; it was titled <i class="citetitle">How to Design a
   Kludge</i> (February 1962, pp. 30, 31).  This spelling was probably
   imported from Great Britain, where <a href="kludge.html"><i class="glossterm">kludge</i></a> has an
   independent history (though this fact was largely unknown to hackers on
   either side of the Atlantic before a mid-1993 debate in the Usenet group
   <tt class="systemitem">alt.folklore.computers</tt> over the
   First and Second Edition versions of this entry; everybody used to think
   <a href="kludge.html"><i class="glossterm">kludge</i></a> was just a mutation of
   <a href="kluge.html"><i class="glossterm">kluge</i></a>).  It now appears that the British, having
   forgotten the etymology of their own &#8216;kludge&#8217; when
   &#8216;kluge&#8217; crossed the Atlantic, repaid the U.S. by lobbing the
   &#8216;kludge&#8217; orthography in the other direction and confusing their
   American cousins' spelling!</p><p>The result of this history is a tangle.  Many younger U.S. hackers
   pronounce the word as <span class="pronunciation">/klooj/</span> but
   spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as
   &#8216;kludge&#8217;. (Phonetically, consider huge, refuge, centrifuge, and
   deluge as opposed to sludge, judge, budge, and fudge.  Whatever its
   failings in other areas, English spelling is perfectly consistent about
   this distinction.)  British hackers mostly learned <span class="pronunciation">/kluhj/</span> orally, use it in a restricted
   negative sense and are at least consistent.  European hackers have mostly
   learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it
   <span class="pronunciation">/kluhj/</span> but use the wider
   American meaning!</p><p>Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's
   meaning.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="kludge.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../K.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="kluge-around.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">kludge </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> kluge around</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
