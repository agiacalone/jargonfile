   who should know better succumbs to marketing influences and actually begins

   believable, that's pouring good Kool-Aid, usually used in the sentence
   &#8220;<span class="quote">He pours good Kool-Aid, doesn't he?</span>&#8221; This connotes that the
   speaker might be about to drink same.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="kook.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../K.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="kremvax.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">kook </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> kremvax</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
