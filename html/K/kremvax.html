   <a href="../V/VAXen.html"><i class="glossterm">VAXen</i></a> with names of the form <tt class="systemitem">foovax</tt>] Originally, a fictitious Usenet site
   at the Kremlin, announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly
   originated there by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko.  The <a href="    http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=0001%40kremvax.UUCP" target="_top"> posting</a>
   was actually forged by Piet Beertema as an April Fool's joke.  Other
   fictitious sites mentioned in the hoax were <tt class="systemitem">moskvax</tt> and <a href="kgbvax.html"><i class="glossterm">kgbvax</i></a>.
   This was probably the funniest of the many April Fool's forgeries
   perpetrated on Usenet (which has negligible security against them), because
   the notion that Usenet might ever penetrate the Iron Curtain seemed so
   totally absurd at the time.</p><p>In fact, it was only six years later that the first genuine site in
   Moscow, <tt class="systemitem">demos.su</tt>, joined Usenet.
   Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it weren't just
   another prank.  Vadim Antonov, senior programmer at Demos and the major
   poster from there up to mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, referred to
   it frequently in his own postings, and at one point twitted some credulous
   readers by blandly asserting that he <span class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> a
   hoax!</p><p>Eventually he even arranged to have the domain's gateway site named
   <tt class="systemitem">kremvax</tt>, thus neatly turning
   fiction into fact and demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor
   transcends cultural barriers.  [Mr. Antonov also contributed the
   Russian-language material for this lexicon. &#8212;ESR]</p><p>In an even more ironic historical footnote, <tt class="systemitem">kremvax</tt> became an electronic center of the
   anti-communist resistance during the bungled hard-line coup of August 1991.
   During those three days the Soviet UUCP network centered on <tt class="systemitem">kremvax</tt> became the only trustworthy news
   source for many places within the USSR.  Though the sysops were
   concentrating on internal communications, cross-border postings included
   immediate transliterations of Boris Yeltsin's decrees condemning the coup
   and eyewitness reports of the demonstrations in Moscow's streets.  In those
   hours, years of speculation that totalitarianism would prove unable to
   maintain its grip on politically-loaded information in the age of computer
   networking were proved devastatingly accurate &#8212; and the original
   <tt class="systemitem">kremvax</tt> joke became a reality as
   Yeltsin and the new Russian revolutionaries of <span class="firstterm">glasnost</span> and <span class="firstterm">perestroika</span> made <tt class="systemitem">kremvax</tt> one of the timeliest means of their
   outreach to the West.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Kool-Aid.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../K.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="kyrka.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Kool-Aid </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> kyrka</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
