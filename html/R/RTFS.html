   &#8216;Read The Fucking Source&#8217;.  Variant form of
   <a href="RTFM.html"><i class="glossterm">RTFM</i></a>, used when the problem at hand is not
   necessarily obvious and not answerable from the manuals &#8212; or the
   manuals are not yet written and maybe never will be.  For even trickier
   situations, see <a href="RTFB.html"><i class="glossterm">RTFB</i></a>.  Unlike RTFM, the anger
   inherent in RTFS is not usually directed at the person asking the question,
   but rather at the people who failed to provide adequate documentation.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 2. <span class="grammar">imp.</span> &#8216;Read The Fucking
   Standard&#8217;; this oath can only be used when the problem area (e.g., a
   language or operating system interface) has actually been codified in a
   ratified standards document.  The existence of these standards documents
   (and the technically inappropriate but politically mandated compromises
   that they inevitably contain, and the impenetrable
   <a href="../L/legalese.html"><i class="glossterm">legalese</i></a> in which they are invariably written, and
   the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are produced)
   can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a certain amount of ambiguity
   in the specifications of the systems they use.  (Hackers feel that such
   ambiguities are acceptable as long as the <a href="Right-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Right
   Thing</i></a> to do is obvious to any thinking observer; sadly, this
   casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when a system
   becomes popular in the <a href="Real-World.html"><i class="glossterm">Real World</i></a>.)  Since a hacker
   is likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
   technically deficient, the deprecation inherent in this term may be
   directed as much against the standard as against the person who ought to
   read it.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="RTFM.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../R.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="RTI.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">RTFM </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> RTI</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
