   Quiche</i>] A particular sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a
   flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when justified by
   experience.  The archetypal <span class="firstterm">Real
   Programmer</span> likes to program on the <a href="../B/bare-metal.html"><i class="glossterm">bare
   metal</i></a> and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes
   for every machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and
   uses a debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps.
   Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been tuned into a
   state of <a href="../T/tense.html"><i class="glossterm">tense</i></a>ness just short of rupture.  Real
   Programmers never use comments or write documentation: &#8220;<span class="quote">If it was
   hard to write</span>&#8221;, says the Real Programmer, &#8220;<span class="quote">it should be hard
   to understand.</span>&#8221; Real Programmers can make machines do things that
   were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy
   unless doing so.  A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish
   brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls.  Real Programmers live on
   junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the
   crap out of other programmers &#8212; because someday, somebody else might
   have to try to understand their code in order to change it.  Their
   successors generally consider it a <a href="../G/Good-Thing.html"><i class="glossterm">Good Thing</i></a> that
   there aren't many Real Programmers around any more.  For a famous (and
   somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see <a href="../story-of-mel.html" title="The Story of Mel">The Story of Mel'</a> in Appendix A.  The term
   itself was popularized by a letter to the editor in the July 1983
   Datamation titled <i class="citetitle">Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal</i>
   by Ed Post, still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line
   form.</p><p>Typing <i class="citetitle">Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal</i> into
   a web search engine should turn up a copy.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="real-operating-system.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../R.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Real-Soon-Now.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">real operating system </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Real Soon Now</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
