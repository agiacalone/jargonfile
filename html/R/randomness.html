   reasons which are (a) too tiresome to bother inquiring into, (b) are
   probably as inscrutable as quantum phenomena anyway, and (c) are likely to
   pass with time. &#8220;<span class="quote">Maybe he has a real complaint, or maybe it's just

   have, it is worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable
   resource, very useful for applications in cryptography and elsewhere.
   Computers are so thoroughly deterministic that they have a hard time
   generating high-quality randomness, so hackers have sometimes felt the need
   to built special-purpose contraptions for this purpose alone.  One
   well-known website offers random bits <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/" target="_top"> generated by radioactive
   decay</a>.  Another derives random bits from <a href="http://lavarnd.org/" target="_top">chaotic systems</a> in analog electronics.
   Originally, the latter site got its random bits by doing photometry on lava
   lamps.  Hackers invariably found this hilarious.  If you have to ask why,
   you'll never get it.)</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="random-numbers.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../R.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="rape.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">random numbers </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> rape</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
