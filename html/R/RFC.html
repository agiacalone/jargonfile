   numbered Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by
   commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.
   Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet
   mail-format standard).  The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated by
   technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by the
   Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an institution
   such as ANSI.  For this reason, they remain known as RFCs even once adopted
   as standards.</p><p>The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has important
   advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process typical of ANSI
   or ISO.  Emblematic of some of these advantages is the existence of a
   flourishing tradition of &#8216;joke&#8217; RFCs; usually at least one a
   year is published, usually on April 1st.  Well-known joke RFCs have
   included 527 (&#8220;<span class="quote">ARPAWOCKY</span>&#8221;, R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973),
   748 (&#8220;<span class="quote">Telnet Randomly-Lose Option</span>&#8221;, Mark R. Crispin; 1 April
   1978), and 1149 (&#8220;<span class="quote">A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on
   Avian Carriers</span>&#8221;, D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990).  The first was
   a Lewis Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation
   style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document legalese,
   describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets by carrier
   pigeon (since actually implemented; see Appendix A).  See also
   <a href="../I/Infinite-Monkey-Theorem.html"><i class="glossterm">Infinite-Monkey Theorem</i></a>.</p><p>The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work &#8212; they
   frequently manage to have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in
   informal specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that
   often haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to
   truly worldwide proportions.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="return-from-the-dead.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../R.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="RFE.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">return from the dead </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> RFE</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
