   &#8220;<span class="quote">If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways
   can result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it.</span>&#8221; This is a
   principle of defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in
   mutant forms less descriptive of the challenges of design for
   <a href="../L/luser.html"><i class="glossterm">luser</i></a>s.  For example, you don't make a two-pin plug
   symmetrical and then label it &#8220;<span class="quote">THIS WAY UP</span>&#8221;; if it matters
   which way it is plugged in, then you make the design asymmetrical (see also
   the anecdote under <a href="magic-smoke.html"><i class="glossterm">magic smoke</i></a>).</p><p>Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of McDonnell-Douglas's test
   engineers on the rocket-sled experiments that were done by the U.S. Air
   Force in 1949 to test human acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981).
   One experiment involved a set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different
   parts of the subject's body.  There were two ways each sensor could be
   glued to its mount, and somebody methodically installed all 16 in a
   replacement set the wrong way around.  Murphy then made the original form
   of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John Paul Stapp)
   mis-quoted (apparently in the more general form &#8220;<span class="quote">Whatever can go
   wrong, <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> go wrong)</span>&#8221; at a news conference a
   few days later.</p><p>Within months &#8216;Murphy's Law&#8217; had spread to various
   technical cultures connected to aerospace engineering.  Before too many
   years had gone by variants had passed into the popular imagination,
   changing as they went.  Most of these are variants on &#8220;<span class="quote">Anything that
   can go wrong, will</span>&#8221;; this is more correctly referred to as
   <a href="../F/Finagles-Law.html"><i class="glossterm">Finagle's Law</i></a>.  The memetic drift apparent in these
   mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="munge.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="music.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">munge </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> music</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
