   Derived from Melville's <i class="citetitle">Moby Dick</i> (some say from
   &#8216;Moby Pickle&#8217;). Now common.]  </p></dd><dd><p> 1. <span class="grammar">adj.</span> Large, immense, complex,
   impressive.  &#8220;<span class="quote">A Saturn V rocket is a truly moby frob.</span>&#8221;
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Some MIT undergrads pulled off a moby hack at the Harvard-Yale

   discussion.)</p></dd><dd><p> 2. <span class="grammar">n.</span> obs. The maximum address
   space of a machine (see below).  For a 680[234]0 or
   <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a> or most modern 32-bit architectures, it is
   4,294,967,296 8-bit bytes (4 gigabytes).  </p></dd><dd><p> 3. A title of address (never of third-person reference), usually
   used to show admiration, respect, and/or friendliness to a competent
   hacker.  &#8220;<span class="quote">Greetings, moby Dave.  How's that address-book thing for
   the Mac going?</span>&#8221;</p></dd><dd><p> 4. <span class="grammar">adj.</span> In backgammon, doubles
   on the dice, as in <span class="firstterm">moby sixes</span>,
   <span class="firstterm">moby ones</span>, etc.  Compare this with
   <a href="../B/bignum.html"><i class="glossterm">bignum</i></a> (sense 3): double sixes are both bignums and
   moby sixes, but moby ones are not bignums (the use of <span class="firstterm">moby</span> to describe double ones is sarcastic).
   Standard emphatic forms: <span class="firstterm">Moby foo</span>,
   <span class="firstterm">moby win</span>, <span class="firstterm">moby loss</span>.  <span class="firstterm">Foby
   moo</span>: a spoonerism due to Richard Greenblatt.  </p></dd><dd><p> 5. The largest available unit of something which is available in
   discrete increments.  Thus, ordering a &#8220;<span class="quote">moby Coke</span>&#8221; at the
   local fast-food joint is not just a request for a large Coke, it's an
   explicit request for the largest size they sell.</p></dd><dd><p>This term entered hackerdom with the Fabritek 256K memory added to
   the MIT AI PDP-6 machine, which was considered unimaginably huge when it
   was installed in the 1960s (at a time when a more typical memory size for a
   timesharing system was 72 kilobytes).  Thus, a moby is classically 256K
   36-bit words, the size of a PDP-6 or PDP-10 moby.  Back when address
   registers were narrow the term was more generally useful, because when a
   computer had virtual memory mapping, it might actually have more physical
   memory attached to it than any one program could access directly.  One
   could then say &#8220;<span class="quote">This computer has 6 mobies</span>&#8221; meaning that the
   ratio of physical memory to address space is 6, without having to say
   specifically how much memory there actually is.  That in turn implied that
   the computer could timeshare six &#8216;full-sized&#8217; programs without
   having to swap programs between memory and disk.</p><p>Nowadays the low cost of processor logic means that address spaces
   are usually larger than the most physical memory you can cram onto a
   machine, so most systems have much <span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> than one
   theoretical &#8216;native&#8217; moby of <a href="../C/core.html"><i class="glossterm">core</i></a>.
   Also, more modern memory-management techniques (esp. paging) make the
   &#8216;moby count&#8217; less significant.  However, there is one series of
   widely-used chips for which the term could stand to be revived &#8212; the
   Intel 8088 and 80286 with their incredibly
   <a href="../B/brain-damaged.html"><i class="glossterm">brain-damaged</i></a> segmented-memory designs.  On these, a
   <span class="firstterm">moby</span> would be the 1-megabyte address
   span of a segment/offset pair (by coincidence, a PDP-10 moby was exactly 1
   megabyte of 9-bit bytes).</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="mobo.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="mockingbird.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">mobo </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> mockingbird</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
