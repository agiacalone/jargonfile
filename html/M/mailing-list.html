   <a href="macro.html"><i class="glossterm">macro</i></a>, though that word is never used in this

   <span class="firstterm">reflectors</span>, redirecting mail sent to

   of varying degrees of sophistication; lists filtered by humans are said to

   along with <a href="../U/Usenet.html"><i class="glossterm">Usenet</i></a>.  They predate Usenet, having
   originated with the first UUCP and ARPANET connections.  They are often
   used for private information-sharing on topics that would be too
   specialized for or inappropriate to public Usenet groups.  Though some of
   these maintain almost purely technical content (such as the Internet
   Engineering Task Force mailing list), others (like the
   &#8216;sf-lovers&#8217; list maintained for many years by Saul Jaffe) are
   recreational, and many are purely social.  Perhaps the most infamous of the
   social lists was the eccentric <tt class="systemitem">bandykin</tt> distribution; its latter-day progeny,
   <tt class="systemitem">lectroids</tt> and <tt class="systemitem">tanstaafl</tt>, still include a number of the
   oddest and most interesting people in hackerdom.</p><p>Mailing lists are easy to create and (unlike Usenet) don't tie up a
   significant amount of machine resources (until they get very large, at
   which point they can become interesting torture tests for mail software).
   Thus, they are often created temporarily by working groups, the members of
   which can then collaborate on a project without ever needing to meet
   face-to-face.  Much of the material in this lexicon was criticized and
   polished on just such a mailing list (called &#8216;jargon-friends&#8217;),
   which included all the co-authors of Steele-1983.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="mailbomb.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="main-loop.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">mailbomb </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> main loop</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
