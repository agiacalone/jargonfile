   eats, sleeps, and breathes MUD.  Mudheads have been known to fail their
   degrees, drop out, etc., with the consolation, however, that they made
   wizard level.  When encountered in person, on a MUD, or in a chat system,
   all a mudhead will talk about is three topics: the tactic, character, or
   wizard that is supposedly always unfairly stopping him/her from becoming a
   wizard or beating a favorite MUD; why the specific game he/she has
   experience with is so much better than any other; and the MUD he or she is
   writing or going to write because his/her design ideas are so much better
   than in any existing MUD.  See also <a href="../W/wannabee.html"><i class="glossterm">wannabee</i></a>.</p><p>To the anthropologically literate, this term may recall the Zuni/Hopi
   legend of the mudheads or <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">koyemshi</i></span>, mythical
   half-formed children of an unnatural union.  Figures representing them act
   as clowns in Zuni sacred ceremonies.  Others may recall the &#8216;High
   School Madness&#8217; sequence from the Firesign Theatre album
   <i class="citetitle">Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers</i>, in which
   there is a character named &#8220;<span class="quote">Mudhead</span>&#8221;.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="muddie.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="muggle.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">muddie </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> muggle</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
