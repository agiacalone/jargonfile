   Mars was the code name for a family of PDP-10-compatible computers built by
   Systems Concepts (now, The SC Group): the multi-processor SC-30M, the small
   uniprocessor SC-25, and the never-built superprocessor SC-40.  These
   machines were marvels of engineering design; although not much slower than
   the unique <a href="../F/Foonly.html"><i class="glossterm">Foonly</i></a> F-1, they were physically smaller
   and consumed less power than the much slower <a href="../D/DEC.html"><i class="glossterm">DEC</i></a>
   KS10 or Foonly F-2, F-3, or F-4 machines.  They were also completely
   compatible with the DEC KL10, and ran all KL10 binaries (including the
   operating system) with no modifications at about 2--3 times faster than a
   KL10.</p><p>When DEC cancelled the Jupiter project in 1983 (their followup to the
   PDP-10), Systems Concepts should have made a bundle selling their machine
   into shops with a lot of software investment in PDP-10s, and in fact their
   spring 1984 announcement generated a great deal of excitement in the PDP-10
   world.  TOPS-10 was running on the Mars by the summer of 1984, and TOPS-20
   by early fall.  Unfortunately, the hackers running Systems Concepts were
   much better at designing machines than at mass producing or selling them;
   the company allowed itself to be sidetracked by a bout of perfectionism
   into continually improving the design, and lost credibility as delivery
   dates continued to slip.  They also overpriced the product ridiculously;
   they believed they were competing with the KL10 and
   <a href="../V/VAX.html"><i class="glossterm">VAX</i></a> 8600 and failed to reckon with the likes of Sun
   Microsystems and other hungry startups building workstations with power
   comparable to the KL10 at a fraction of the price.  By the time SC shipped
   the first SC-30M to Stanford in late 1985, most customers had already made
   the traumatic decision to abandon the PDP-10, usually for VMS or Unix
   boxes.  Most of the Mars computers built ended up being purchased by
   CompuServe.</p><p>This tale and the related saga of <a href="../F/Foonly.html"><i class="glossterm">Foonly</i></a> hold
