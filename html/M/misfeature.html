   [common] A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is
   not adequate for a new situation that has evolved.  Since it results from a
   deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a bug.
   Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the
   feature in question was carefully planned, but its long-term consequences
   were not accurately or adequately predicted (which is quite different from
   not having thought ahead at all).  A misfeature can be a particularly
   stubborn problem to resolve, because fixing it usually involves a
   substantial philosophical change to the structure of the system
   involved.</p><p>Many misfeatures (especially in user-interface design) arise because
   the designers/implementors mistake their personal tastes for laws of
   nature.  Often a former feature becomes a misfeature because trade-offs
   were made whose parameters subsequently change (possibly only in the
   judgment of the implementors).  &#8220;<span class="quote">Well, yeah, it is kind of a
   misfeature that file names are limited to six characters, but the original
   implementors wanted to save directory space and we're stuck with it for
   now.</span>&#8221;</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="misbug.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="missile-address.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">misbug </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> missile address</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
