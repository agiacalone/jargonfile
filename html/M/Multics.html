   An early timesharing <a href="../O/operating-system.html"><i class="glossterm">operating system</i></a> co-designed
   by a consortium including MIT, GE, and Bell Laboratories as a successor to
   <a href="../C/CTSS.html"><i class="glossterm">CTSS</i></a>.  The design was first presented in 1965,
   planned for operation in 1967, first operational in 1969, and took several
   more years to achieve respectable performance and stability.</p><p>Multics was very innovative for its time &#8212; among other things,
   it provided a hierarchical file system with access control on individual
   files and introduced the idea of treating all devices uniformly as special
   files.  It was also the first OS to run on a symmetric multiprocessor, and
   the only general-purpose system to be awarded a B2 security rating by the
   NSA (see <a href="../O/Orange-Book.html"><i class="glossterm">Orange Book</i></a>).</p><p>Bell Labs left the development effort in 1969 after judging that
   <a href="../S/second-system-effect.html"><i class="glossterm">second-system effect</i></a> had bloated Multics to the
   point of practical unusability.  Honeywell commercialized Multics in 1972
   after buying out GE's computer group, but it was never very successful: at
   its peak in the 1980s, there were between 75 and 100 Multics sites, each a
   multi-million dollar mainframe.</p><p>One of the former Multics developers from Bell Labs was Ken Thompson,
   and <a href="../U/Unix.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix</i></a> deliberately carried through and extended
   many of Multics' design ideas; indeed, Thompson described the very name
   &#8216;Unix&#8217; as &#8220;<span class="quote">a weak pun on Multics</span>&#8221;.  For this and
   other reasons, aspects of the Multics design remain a topic of occasional
   debate among hackers.  See also <a href="../B/brain-damaged.html"><i class="glossterm">brain-damaged</i></a> and
   <a href="../G/GCOS.html"><i class="glossterm">GCOS</i></a>.</p><p>MIT ended its development association with Multics in 1977.
   Honeywell sold its computer business to Bull in the mid 80s, and
   development on Multics was stopped in 1988.  Four Multics sites were known
   to be still in use as late as 1998, but the last one (a Canadian military
   site) was decommissioned in November 2000.  There is a Multics page at
