   programming language design that is heavy on the syntax (with lots of BNF),
   sometimes even talks about semantics (e.g., type systems), but rarely, if
   ever, has any content (see <a href="../C/content-free.html"><i class="glossterm">content-free</i></a>).  More
   broadly applied to talks &#8212; even when the topic is not a programming
   language &#8212; in which the subject matter is gone into in unnecessary
   and meticulous detail at the sacrifice of any conceptual content.
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Well, it was a typical MFTL talk</span>&#8221;.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. <span class="grammar">n.</span> Describes a language about
   which the developers are passionate (often to the point of proselytic zeal)
   but no one else cares about.  Applied to the language by those outside the
   originating group.  &#8220;<span class="quote">He cornered me about type resolution in his
   MFTL.</span>&#8221;</p><p>The first great goal in the mind of the designer of an MFTL is
   usually to write a compiler for it, then bootstrap the design away from
   contamination by lesser languages by writing a compiler for it in itself.
   Thus, the standard put-down question at an MFTL talk is &#8220;<span class="quote">Has it been
   used for anything besides its own compiler?</span>&#8221; On the other hand, a
   (compiled) language that cannot even be used to write its own compiler is
   beneath contempt.  (The qualification has become necessary because of the
   increasing popularity of interpreted languages like
   <a href="../P/Perl.html"><i class="glossterm">Perl</i></a> and <a href="../P/Python.html"><i class="glossterm">Python</i></a>.) See
   <a href="../B/break-even-point.html"><i class="glossterm">break-even point</i></a>.  (On a related note, Doug McIlroy
   once proposed a test of the generality and utility of a language and the
   operating system under which it is compiled: &#8220;<span class="quote">Is the output of a
   FORTRAN program acceptable as input to the FORTRAN compiler?</span>&#8221; In
   other words, can you write programs that write programs? (See
   <a href="../T/toolsmith.html"><i class="glossterm">toolsmith</i></a>.)  Alarming numbers of (language, OS)
   pairs fail this test, particularly when the language is FORTRAN;
   aficionados are quick to point out that <a href="../U/Unix.html"><i class="glossterm">Unix</i></a> (even
   using FORTRAN) passes it handily.  That the test could ever be failed is
   only surprising to those who have had the good fortune to have worked only
   under modern systems which lack OS-supported and -imposed &#8220;<span class="quote">file
   types</span>&#8221;.)</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="metasyntactic-variable.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="mickey.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">metasyntactic variable </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> mickey</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
