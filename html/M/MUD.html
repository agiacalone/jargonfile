A class of <a href="../V/virtual-reality.html"><i class="glossterm">virtual reality</i></a> experiments
   accessible via the Internet.  These are real-time chat forums with
   structure; they have multiple &#8216;locations&#8217; like an adventure
   game, and may include combat, traps, puzzles, magic, a simple economic
   system, and the capability for characters to build more structure onto the
   database that represents the existing world.  </p></dd><dd><p> 2. <span class="grammar">vi.</span> To play a MUD.  The
   acronym MUD is often lowercased and/or verbed; thus, one may speak of
   <span class="firstterm">going mudding</span>, etc.</p></dd><dd><p>Historically, MUDs (and their more recent progeny with names of MU-
   form) derive from a hack by Richard Bartle and Roy Trubshaw on the
   University of Essex's DEC-10 in the early 1980s; descendants of that game
   still exist today and are sometimes generically called
   <span class="emphasis"><em>BartleMUD</em></span>s.  There is a widespread myth (repeated,
   unfortunately, by earlier versions of this lexicon) that the name MUD was
   trademarked to the commercial MUD run by Bartle on British Telecom (the
   motto: &#8220;<span class="quote">You haven't <span class="emphasis"><em>lived</em></span> 'til you've
   <span class="emphasis"><em>died</em></span> on MUD!</span>&#8221;); however, this is false &#8212;
   Richard Bartle explicitly placed &#8216;MUD&#8217; in the public domain in
   1985.  BT was upset at this, as they had already printed trademark claims
   on some maps and posters, which were released and created the myth.</p><p>Students on the European academic networks quickly improved on the
   MUD concept, spawning several new MUDs (VAXMUD, AberMUD, LPMUD).  Many of
   these had associated bulletin-board systems for social interaction.
   Because these had an image as &#8216;research&#8217; they often survived
   administrative hostility to BBSs in general.  This, together with the fact
   that Usenet feeds were often spotty and difficult to get in the U.K., made
   the MUDs major foci of hackish social interaction there.</p><p>AberMUD and other variants crossed the Atlantic around 1988 and
   quickly gained popularity in the U.S.; they became nuclei for large hacker
   communities with only loose ties to traditional hackerdom (some observers
   see parallels with the growth of Usenet in the early 1980s).  The second
   wave of MUDs (TinyMUD and variants) tended to emphasize social interaction,
   puzzles, and cooperative world-building as opposed to combat and
   competition (in writing, these social MUDs are sometimes referred to as
   &#8216;MU*&#8217;, with &#8216;MUD&#8217; implicitly reserved for the more
   game-oriented ones).  By 1991, over 50% of MUD sites were of a third major
   variety, LPMUD, which synthesizes the combat/puzzle aspects of AberMUD and
   older systems with the extensibility of TinyMud.  In 1996 the cutting edge
   of the technology is Pavel Curtis's MOO, even more extensible using a
   built-in object-oriented language.  The trend toward greater
   programmability and flexibility will doubtless continue.</p><p>The state of the art in MUD design is still moving very rapidly, with
   new simulation designs appearing (seemingly) every month.  Around 1991
   there was an unsuccessful movement to deprecate the term
   <a href="MUD.html"><i class="glossterm">MUD</i></a> itself, as newer designs exhibit an exploding
   variety of names corresponding to the different simulation styles being
   explored.  It survived.  See also <a href="../B/bonk-oif.html"><i class="glossterm">bonk/oif</i></a>,
