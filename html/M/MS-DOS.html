   <a href="../C/CP-M.html"><i class="glossterm">CP/M</i></a> for the 8088 crufted together in 6 weeks by
   hacker Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Products, who called the original
   QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) and is said to have regretted it
   ever since.  Microsoft licensed QDOS in order to have something to demo for
   IBM on time, and the rest is history.  Numerous features, including vaguely
   Unix-like but rather broken support for subdirectories, I/O redirection,
   and pipelines, were hacked into Microsoft's 2.0 and subsequent versions; as
   a result, there are two or more incompatible versions of many system calls,
   and MS-DOS programmers can never agree on basic things like what character
   to use as an option switch or whether to be case-sensitive.  The resulting
   appalling mess is now the highest-unit-volume OS in history.  Often known
   simply as DOS, which annoys people familiar with other similarly
   abbreviated operating systems (the name goes back to the mid-1960s, when it
   was attached to IBM's first disk operating system for the 360).  The name
   further annoys those who know what the term 
   <a href="../O/operating-system.html"><i class="glossterm">operating system</i></a> does (or ought to) connote; DOS is more properly a set
   of relatively simple interrupt services.  Some people like to pronounce DOS
   like &#8220;<span class="quote">dose</span>&#8221;, as in &#8220;<span class="quote">I don't work on dose, man!</span>&#8221;,
   or to compare it to a dose of brain-damaging drugs (a slogan button in wide
   circulation among hackers exhorts: &#8220;<span class="quote">MS-DOS: Just say No!</span>&#8221;).
