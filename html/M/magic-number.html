In source code, some non-obvious constant whose value is
   significant to the operation of a program and that is inserted
   inconspicuously in-line (<a href="../H/hardcoded.html"><i class="glossterm">hardcoded</i></a>), rather than
   expanded in by a symbol set by a commented <b class="command">#define</b>.  Magic numbers in this sense are bad style.
   </p></dd><dd><p> 2. A number that encodes critical information used in an algorithm
   in some opaque way.  The classic examples of these are the numbers used in
   hash or CRC functions, or the coefficients in a linear congruential
   generator for pseudo-random numbers.  This sense actually predates and was
   ancestral to the more common sense</p></dd><dd><p> 3. Special data located at the beginning of a binary data file to
   indicate its type to a utility.  Under Unix, the system and various
   applications programs (especially the linker) distinguish between types of
   executable file by looking for a magic number.  Once upon a time, these
   magic numbers were <a href="../P/PDP-11.html"><i class="glossterm">PDP-11</i></a> branch instructions that
   skipped over header data to the start of executable code; 0407, for
   example, was octal for &#8216;branch 16 bytes relative&#8217;.  Many other
   kinds of files now have magic numbers somewhere; some magic numbers are, in
   fact, strings, like the <tt class="literal">!&lt;arch&gt;</tt> at the beginning
   of a Unix archive file or the <tt class="literal">%!</tt> leading PostScript
   files.  Nowadays only a <a href="../W/wizard.html"><i class="glossterm">wizard</i></a> knows the spells to
   create magic numbers.  How do you choose a fresh magic number of your own?
   Simple &#8212; you pick one at random.  See?  It's magic!  </p></dd><dd><p> 4. An input that leads to a computational boundary condition, where
   algorithm behavior becomes discontinuous.  Numeric overflows (particularly
   with signed data types) and run-time errors (divide by zero, stack
   overflows) are indications of magic numbers.  The Y2K scare was probably
   the most notorious magic number non-incident.</p></dd><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The</em></span> magic number, on the other hand, is
   <tt class="literal">7±2</tt>.  See <i class="citetitle">The magical
   number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing
   information</i> by George Miller, in the <i class="citetitle">Psychological
   Review</i> 63:81-97 (1956).  This classic paper established the
   number of distinct items (such as numeric digits) that humans can hold in
   short-term memory.  Among other things, this strongly influenced the
   interface design of the phone system.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="magic-cookie.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="magic-smoke.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">magic cookie </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> magic smoke</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
