   or cost to a 2<sup>t</sup> exponential curve, with doubling
   time close to a year.  The most common fits component density to such a
   curve (previous versions of this entry gave that form).  Another variant
   asserts that the dollar cost of constant computing power decreases on the
   same curve.  The original Moore's Law, first uttered in 1965 by
   semiconductor engineer Gordon Moore (who co-founded Intel four years
   later), spoke of the number of components on the lowest-cost silicon
   integrated circuits &#8212; but Moore's own formulation varied somewhat
   over the years, and reconstructing the meaning of the terminology he used
   in the original turns out to be fraught with difficulties.  Further
   variants were spawned by Intel's PR department and various
   journalists.</p><p>It has been <a href="http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html" target="_top">shown</a>
   that none of the variants of Moore's Law actually fit the data very well
   (the price curves within DRAM generations perhaps come closest).
   Nevertheless, Moore's Law is constantly invoked to set up expectations
   about the next generation of computing technology.  See also
