   <a href="../A/arg.html"><i class="glossterm">arg</i></a> list) that is equated to a text or symbolic
   expression to which it is to be expanded (possibly with the substitution of
   actual arguments) by a macro expander.  This definition can be found in any
   technical dictionary; what those won't tell you is how the hackish
   connotations of the term have changed over time.</p><p>The term <span class="firstterm">macro</span> originated in
   early assemblers, which encouraged the use of macros as a structuring and
   information-hiding device.  During the early 1970s, macro assemblers became
   ubiquitous, and sometimes quite as powerful and expensive as
   <a href="../H/HLL.html"><i class="glossterm">HLL</i></a>s, only to fall from favor as improving compiler
   technology marginalized assembler programming (see 
   <a href="../L/languages-of-choice.html"><i class="glossterm">languages of choice</i></a>).  Nowadays the term is most often used in connection
   with the C preprocessor, LISP, or one of several special-purpose languages
   built around a macro-expansion facility (such as TeX or Unix's [nt]roff
   suite).</p><p>Indeed, the meaning has drifted enough that the collective <span class="firstterm">macros</span> is now sometimes used for code in any
   special-purpose application control language (whether or not the language
   is actually translated by text expansion), and for macro-like entities such
   as the <span class="firstterm">keyboard macros</span> supported in
   some text editors (and PC TSR or Macintosh INIT/CDEV keyboard
   enhancers).</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Macintrash.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../M.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="macro-.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Macintrash </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> macro-</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
