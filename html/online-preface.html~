illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.</p><p>This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal restraints on
what you can do with it, but there are traditions about its proper use to
which many hackers are quite strongly attached.  Please extend the courtesy of
proper citation when you quote the File, ideally with a version number, as it
will change and grow over time.  (Examples of appropriate citation form:
&#8220;<span class="quote">Jargon File 4.4.6</span>&#8221; or &#8220;<span class="quote">The on-line hacker Jargon File,
version 4.4.6,  4 Oct 2003</span>&#8221;.)</p><p>The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture.  Over the
years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable time to
maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large as editors of it.
Editorial responsibilities include: to collate contributions and suggestions
from others; to seek out corroborating information; to cross-reference related
entries; to keep the file in a consistent format; and to announce and
distribute updated versions periodically.  Current volunteer editors
include:</p><p>Eric Raymond <tt class="email">&lt;<a href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">esr@thyrsus.com</a>&gt;</tt></p><p>Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published work or
commercial product.  We may have additional information that would be helpful
to you and can assist you in framing your quote to reflect not only the letter
of the File but its spirit as well.</p><p>All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.</p><p>From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited, and
formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the volunteer
editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to have a bound paper
copy of this file, you may find it convenient to purchase one of these.  They
often contain additional material not found in on-line versions.  The three
&#8216;authorized&#8217; editions so far are described in the Revision History
section; there may be more in the future.</p><p>The Jargon File's online rendition uses an unusually large number of
special characters.  This test page lists them so you can check what your
browser does with each one.</p><div class="informaltable"><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>glyph</td><td>description</td></tr><tr><td>&#955;</td><td>greek character lambda</td></tr><tr><td>&#923;</td><td>greek character Lambda</td></tr><tr><td>&#960;</td><td>greek character pi</td></tr><tr><td>£</td><td>pound sterling</td></tr><tr><td>&#12296;</td><td>left angle bracket</td></tr><tr><td>&#12297;</td><td>right angle bracket</td></tr><tr><td>æ</td><td>ae ligature</td></tr><tr><td>ß</td><td>German sharp-s sign</td></tr><tr><td>&#8764;</td><td>similarity sign</td></tr><tr><td>&#8853;</td><td>circle-plus</td></tr><tr><td>&#8855;</td><td>circle-times</td></tr><tr><td>×</td><td>times</td></tr><tr><td>&#8709;</td><td>empty set (used for APL null)</td></tr><tr><td>µ</td><td>micro quantifier sign</td></tr><tr><td>&#8594;</td><td>right arrow</td></tr><tr><td>&#8660;</td><td>horizontal double arrow</td></tr><tr><td>&#8482;</td><td>trademark symbol</td></tr><tr><td>®</td><td>registered-trademark symbol</td></tr><tr><td>&#8722;</td><td>minus</td></tr><tr><td>±</td><td>plus-or-minus</td></tr><tr><td>Ø</td><td>slashed-O</td></tr><tr><td>&#601;</td><td>schwa</td></tr><tr><td>´</td><td>acute accent</td></tr><tr><td>·</td><td>medial dot</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="pt01.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Jargon File </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Part I. Introduction</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
