motorcycle accident and broke his leg.  He had to stay in the hospital quite a
while, and got restless because he couldn't <a href="H/hack.html"><i class="glossterm">hack</i></a>.  Two
of his friends therefore took a terminal and a modem for it to the hospital,
so that he could use the computer by telephone from his hospital bed.  </p><p>Now this happened some years before the spread of home computers, and
computer terminals were not a familiar sight to the average person.  When the
two friends got to the hospital, a guard stopped them and asked what they were
carrying.  They explained that they wanted to take a computer terminal to
their friend who was a patient.</p><p>The guard got out his list of things that patients were permitted to
have in their rooms: TV, radio, electric razor, typewriter, tape player,
... no computer terminals.  Computer terminals weren't on the list, so
the guard wouldn't let it in.  Rules are rules, you know.  (This guard was
clearly a <a href="D/droid.html"><i class="glossterm">droid</i></a>.)</p><p>Fair enough, said the two friends, and they left again.  They were
frustrated, of course, because they knew that the terminal was as harmless as
a TV or anything else on the list... which gave them an idea. </p><p>The next day they returned, and the same thing happened: a guard stopped
them and asked what they were carrying.  They said: “<span class="quote">This is a TV
typewriter!</span>” The guard was skeptical, so they plugged it in and
demonstrated it.  “<span class="quote">See?  You just type on the keyboard and what you type
shows up on the TV screen.</span>” Now the guard didn't stop to think about
how utterly useless a typewriter would be that didn't produce any paper copies
of what you typed; but this was clearly a TV typewriter, no doubt about it.
So he checked his list: “A TV is all right, a typewriter is all right
... okay, take it on in!”</p><p>[Historical note: Many years ago, <i class="citetitle">Popular
Electronics</i> published solder-it-yourself plans for a TV
typewriter.  Despite the essential uselessness of the device, it was an
enormously popular project.  Steve Ciarcia, the man behind
<i class="citetitle">Byte</i> magazine's “<span class="quote">Circuit Cellar</span>” feature,
resurrected this ghost in one of his books of the early 1980s.  He ascribed
its popularity (no doubt correctly) to the feeling of power the builder could
achieve by being able to decide himself what would be shown on the TV. And, in
fact, the device was not entirely useless; when combined with a modem board,
it became a crude but serviceable terminal. —ESR]</p><p>[Antihistorical note: On September 23rd, 1992, the L.A. Times ran the
following bit in Steve Harvey's ‘Only in L.A.' column:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It must have been borrowed from a museum: Solomon Waters of Altadena, a
6-year-old first-grader, came home from his first day of school and excitedly
told his mother how he had written on “<span class="quote">a machine that looks like a
computer--but without the TV screen.</span>”</p><p>She asked him if it could have been a “<span class="quote">typewriter.</span>”</p><p>“<span class="quote">Yeah! Yeah!</span>” he said. “<span class="quote">That's what it was
called.</span>”</p></blockquote></div><p>I have since investigated this matter and determined that many of
today's teenagers have never seen a slide rule, either....
