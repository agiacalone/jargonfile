   family of very early computer games called <i class="citetitle">Hunt The
   Wumpus</i>.  The original was invented in 1970 (several years
   before <a href="../A/ADVENT.html"><i class="glossterm">ADVENT</i></a>) by Gregory Yob.  The wumpus lived
   somewhere in a cave with the topology of an dodecahedron's edge/vertex
   graph (later versions supported other topologies, including an icosahedron
   and Möbius strip). The player started somewhere at random in the cave
   with five &#8216;crooked arrows&#8217;; these could be shot through up to
   three connected rooms, and would kill the wumpus on a hit (later versions
   introduced the wounded wumpus, which got very angry).  Unfortunately for
   players, the movement necessary to map the maze was made hazardous not
   merely by the wumpus (which would eat you if you stepped on him) but also
   by bottomless pits and colonies of super bats that would pick you up and
   drop you at a random location (later versions added &#8216;anaerobic
   termites&#8217; that ate arrows, bat migrations, and earthquakes that
   randomly changed pit locations).</p><p>This game appears to have been the first to use a non-random
   graph-structured map (as opposed to a rectangular grid like the even older
   Star Trek games).  In this respect, as in the dungeon-like setting and its
   terse, amusing messages, it prefigured <a href="../A/ADVENT.html"><i class="glossterm">ADVENT</i></a> and
   <a href="../Z/Zork.html"><i class="glossterm">Zork</i></a> and was directly ancestral to the latter (Zork
   acknowledged this heritage by including a super-bat colony).  A C emulation
   of the original Basic game is available at the Retrocomputing Museum,
