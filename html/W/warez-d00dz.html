   themselves as <span class="firstterm">warez d00dz</span>; there is

   &#8216;Ozone Pilot&#8217;, one former warez d00d, wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Warez d00dz get illegal copies of copyrighted software.  If
it has copy protection on it, they break the protection so
the software can be copied.  Then they distribute it around
the world via several gateways.  Warez d00dz form badass
group names like RAZOR and the like.  They put up boards
that distribute the latest ware, or pirate program.  The
whole point of the Warez sub-culture is to get the pirate
program released and distributed before any other group.  I
know, I know.  But don't ask, and it won't hurt as much.
This is how they prove their poweress [sic].  It gives them
the right to say, &#8220;<span class="quote">I released King's Quest IVXIX before you
so obviously my testicles are larger.</span>&#8221; Again don't ask...
</p></blockquote></div><p>The studly thing to do if one is a warez d00d, it appears, is emit
   <span class="firstterm">0-day warez</span>, that is copies of
   commercial software copied and cracked on the same day as its retail
   release.  Warez d00ds also hoard software in a big way, collecting untold
   megabytes of arcade-style games, pornographic JPGs, and applications
   they'll never use onto their hard disks.  As Ozone Pilot acutely
   observes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[BELONG] is the only word you will need
   to know.  Warez d00dz want to belong.  They have been shunned by everyone,
   and thus turn to cyberspace for acceptance.  That is why they always start
   groups like TGW, FLT, USA and the like.  Structure makes them happy. [...]
   Warez d00dz will never have a handle like &#8220;<span class="quote">Pink Daisy</span>&#8221; because
   warez d00dz are insecure.  Only someone who is very secure with a good dose
   of self-esteem can stand up to the cries of fag and girlie-man.  More
   likely you will find warez d00dz with handles like: Doctor Death, Deranged
   Lunatic, Hellraiser, Mad Prince, Dreamdevil, The Unknown, Renegade Chemist,
   Terminator, and Twin Turbo.  They like to sound badass when they can hide
   behind their terminals.  More likely, if you were given a sample of 100
   people, the person whose handle is Hellraiser is the last person you'd
   associate with the name.</p></blockquote></div><p>The contrast with Internet hackers is stark and instructive.  See
