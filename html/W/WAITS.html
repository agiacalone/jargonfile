   handful of systems at <a href="../S/SAIL.html"><i class="glossterm">SAIL</i></a> up to 1990.  There was
   never an &#8216;official&#8217; expansion of WAITS (the name itself having
   been arrived at by a rather sideways process), but it was frequently
   glossed as &#8216;West-coast Alternative to ITS&#8217;.  Though WAITS was
   less visible than ITS, there was frequent exchange of people and ideas
   between the two communities, and innovations pioneered at WAITS exerted
   enormous indirect influence.  The early screen modes of
   <a href="../E/EMACS.html"><i class="glossterm">EMACS</i></a>, for example, were directly inspired by
   WAITS's &#8216;E&#8217; editor &#8212; one of a family of editors that were
   the first to do &#8216;real-time editing&#8217;, in which the editing
   commands were invisible and where one typed text at the point of
   insertion/overwriting.  The modern style of multi-region windowing is said
   to have originated there, and WAITS alumni at XEROX PARC and elsewhere
   played major roles in the developments that led to the XEROX Star, the
   Macintosh, and the Sun workstations.  Also invented there were
   <a href="../B/bucky-bits.html"><i class="glossterm">bucky bits</i></a> &#8212; thus, the ALT key on every IBM PC
   is a WAITS legacy.  One WAITS feature very notable in pre-Web days was a
   news-wire interface that allowed WAITS hackers to read, store, and filter
   AP and UPI dispatches from their terminals; the system also featured a
   still-unusual level of support for what is now called <span class="firstterm">multimedia</span> computing, allowing analog audio and
   video signals to be switched to programming terminals.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="wabbit.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../W.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="waldo.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">wabbit </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> waldo</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
