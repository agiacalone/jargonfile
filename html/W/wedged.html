To be stuck, incapable of proceeding without help.  This is
   different from having crashed.  If the system has crashed, it has become
   totally non-functioning.  If the system is wedged, it is trying to do
   something but cannot make progress; it may be capable of doing a few
   things, but not be fully operational.  For example, a process may become
   wedged if it <a href="../D/deadlock.html"><i class="glossterm">deadlock</i></a>s with another (but not all
   instances of wedging are deadlocks).  See also

   thought to derive from a common description of recto-cranial inversion;
   however, it may actually have originated with older &#8216;hot-press&#8217;
   printing technology in which physical type elements were locked into type
   frames with wedges driven in by mallets.  Once this had been done, no
   changes in the typesetting for that page could be made.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="webmaster.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../W.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="wedgie.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">webmaster </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> wedgie</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
