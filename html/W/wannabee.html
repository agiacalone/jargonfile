   Madonna fans who dress, talk, and act like their idol; prob.: originally
   from biker slang] A would-be <a href="../H/hacker.html"><i class="glossterm">hacker</i></a>.  The
   connotations of this term differ sharply depending on the age and exposure
   of the subject.  Used of a person who is in or might be entering
   <a href="../L/larval-stage.html"><i class="glossterm">larval stage</i></a>, it is semi-approving; such wannabees
   can be annoying but most hackers remember that they, too, were once such
   creatures.  When used of any professional programmer, CS academic, writer,
   or <a href="../S/suit.html"><i class="glossterm">suit</i></a>, it is derogatory, implying that said person
   is trying to cuddle up to the hacker mystique but doesn't, fundamentally,
   have a prayer of understanding what it is all about.  Overuse of terms from
   this lexicon is often an indication of the <a href="wannabee.html"><i class="glossterm">wannabee</i></a>
   nature.  Compare <a href="../N/newbie.html"><i class="glossterm">newbie</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>Historical note: The wannabee phenomenon has a slightly different
   flavor now (1993) than it did ten or fifteen years ago.  When the people
   who are now hackerdom's tribal elders were in <a href="../L/larval-stage.html"><i class="glossterm">larval
   stage</i></a>, the process of becoming a hacker was largely unconscious
   and unaffected by models known in popular culture &#8212; communities
   formed spontaneously around people who, <span class="emphasis"><em>as
   individuals</em></span>, felt irresistibly drawn to do hackerly things, and
   what wannabees experienced was a fairly pure, skill-focused desire to
   become similarly wizardly.  Those days of innocence are gone forever;
   society's adaptation to the advent of the microcomputer after 1980 included
   the elevation of the hacker as a new kind of folk hero, and the result is
   that some people semi-consciously set out to <span class="emphasis"><em>be
   hackers</em></span> and borrow hackish prestige by fitting the popular image
   of hackers.  Fortunately, to do this really well, one has to actually
   become a wizard.  Nevertheless, old-time hackers tend to share a poorly
   articulated disquiet about the change; among other things, it gives them
   mixed feelings about the effects of public compendia of lore like this
   one.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="wank.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../W.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="war-dialer.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">wank </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> war dialer</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
