   in unavoidable ways by the capacities of the operating system or hardware
   they have to work with.  Sometimes they are restricted in avoidable ways by
   mental habits a developer has picked up from a particular language or
   environment (perhaps a now-obsolete one) and never discarded.  When a
   design develops complications that are the result of a mental habit that is
   no longer adaptive, the developer has succumbed to Whorfian mind-lock. The
   design itself has been &#8216;whorfed&#8217;.</p><p>For example, some Unix designs are whorfed by the assumption that
   directory searches are linear and expensive for large directories;
   therefore directories must be kept small.  Another common way to succumb to
   Whorfian mind-lock is to do serial processing with a small working set
   rather than slurping an entire file or data structure into memory; the
   hidden assumption here is that not much core is available and virtual
   memory works poorly if at all.  Detecting Whorfian mind-lock is important,
   because it tends to introduce unnecessary complexity and bugs.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="whizzy.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../W.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="wibble.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">whizzy </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> wibble</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
