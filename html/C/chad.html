[common] The perforated edge strips on printer paper, after they
   have been separated from the printed portion.  Also called
   <a href="../S/selvage.html"><i class="glossterm">selvage</i></a>, <a href="../P/perf.html"><i class="glossterm">perf</i></a>, and
   <a href="../R/ripoff.html"><i class="glossterm">ripoff</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p> 2. The confetti-like paper bits punched out of cards or paper tape;
   this has also been called <span class="firstterm">chaff</span>,
   <span class="firstterm">computer confetti</span>, and <span class="firstterm">keypunch droppings</span>.  It's reported that this
   was very old Army slang (associated with teletypewriters before the
   computer era), and has been occasionally sighted in directions for
   punched-card vote tabulators long after it passed out of live use among
   computer programmers in the late 1970s.  This sense of &#8216;chad&#8217;
   returned to the mainstream during the finale of the hotly disputed
   U.S. presidential election in 2000 via stories about the Florida vote
   recounts.  Note however that in the revived mainstream usage chad is not a
   mass noun and &#8216;a chad&#8217; is a single piece of the stuff.</p></dd><dd><p>There is an urban legend that <span class="firstterm">chad</span> (sense 2) derives from the Chadless
   keypunch (named for its inventor), which cut little u-shaped tabs in the
   card to make a hole when the tab folded back, rather than punching out a
   circle/rectangle; it was clear that if the Chadless keypunch didn't make
   them, then the stuff that other keypunches made had to be
   &#8216;chad&#8217;.  However, serious attempts to track down
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Chadless</span>&#8221; as a personal name or U.S. trademark have failed,
   casting doubt on this etymology &#8212; and the U.S. Patent Classification
   System uses &#8220;<span class="quote">chadless</span>&#8221; (small c) as an adjective, suggesting
   that &#8220;<span class="quote">chadless</span>&#8221; derives from &#8220;<span class="quote">chad</span>&#8221; and not the
   other way around.  There is another legend that the word was originally
   acronymic, standing for &#8220;<span class="quote">Card Hole Aggregate Debris</span>&#8221;, but this
   has all the earmarks of a <a href="../B/backronym.html"><i class="glossterm">backronym</i></a>.  It has also
   been noted that the word &#8220;<span class="quote">chad</span>&#8221; is Scots dialect for gravel,
   but nobody has proposed any plausible reason that card chaff should be
   thought of as gravel.  None of these etymologies is really
   plausible.</p><div class="mediaobject"><a id="crunchly74-12-31"/><img src="../graphics/74-12-31.png"/><div class="caption"><p>This is <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> way to be
