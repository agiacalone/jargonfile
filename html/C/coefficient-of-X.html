   Four particularly important ones involve the terms <span class="firstterm">coefficient</span>, <span class="firstterm">factor</span>, <span class="firstterm">index of
   X</span>, and <span class="firstterm">quotient</span>.  They are
   often loosely applied to things you cannot really be quantitative about,
   but there are subtle distinctions among them that convey information about
   the way the speaker mentally models whatever he or she is describing.
   <span class="firstterm">Foo factor</span> and <span class="firstterm">foo quotient</span> tend to describe something for
   which the issue is one of presence or absence.  The canonical example is
   <a href="../F/fudge-factor.html"><i class="glossterm">fudge factor</i></a>.  It's not important how much you're
   fudging; the term simply acknowledges that some fudging is needed.  You
   might talk of liking a movie for its silliness factor.  Quotient tends to
   imply that the property is a ratio of two opposing factors: &#8220;<span class="quote">I would
   have won except for my luck quotient.</span>&#8221; This could also be &#8220;<span class="quote">I
   would have won except for the luck factor</span>&#8221;, but using
   <span class="emphasis"><em>quotient</em></span> emphasizes that it was bad luck overpowering
   good luck (or someone else's good luck overpowering your own).  <span class="firstterm">Foo index</span> and <span class="firstterm">coefficient of foo</span> both tend to imply that foo
   is, if not strictly measurable, at least something that can be larger or
   smaller.  Thus, you might refer to a paper or person as having a <span class="firstterm">high bogosity index</span>, whereas you would be less
   likely to speak of a <span class="firstterm">high bogosity
   factor</span>.  <span class="firstterm">Foo index</span>
   suggests that foo is a condensation of many quantities, as in the mundane
   cost-of-living index; <span class="firstterm">coefficient of
   foo</span> suggests that foo is a fundamental quantity, as in a
   coefficient of friction.  The choice between these terms is often one of
   personal preference; e.g., some people might feel that bogosity is a
   fundamental attribute and thus say <span class="firstterm">coefficient
   of bogosity</span>, whereas others might feel it is a combination of
   factors and thus say <span class="firstterm">bogosity
   index</span>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="codewalker.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cokebottle.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">codewalker </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> cokebottle</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
