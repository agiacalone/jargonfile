   of the software team will be congruent; commonly stated as &#8220;<span class="quote">If you
   have four groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass
   compiler</span>&#8221;.  The original statement was more general,
   &#8220;<span class="quote">Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce
   designs which are copies of the communication structures of these
   organizations.</span>&#8221; This first appeared in the April 1968 issue of
   <a href="../D/Datamation.html"><i class="glossterm">Datamation</i></a>. Compare 
   <a href="../S/SNAFU-principle.html"><i class="glossterm">SNAFU principle</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>The law was named after Melvin Conway, an early proto-hacker who
   wrote an assembler for the Burroughs 220 called SAVE.  (The name
   &#8216;SAVE&#8217; didn't stand for anything; it was just that you lost
   fewer card decks and listings because they all had SAVE written on them.)
   There is also Tom Cheatham's amendment of Conway's Law: &#8220;<span class="quote">If a group
   of N persons implements a COBOL compiler, there will be N-1 passes.
   Someone in the group has to be the manager.</span>&#8221;</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="control-S.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cookbook.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">control-S </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> cookbook</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
