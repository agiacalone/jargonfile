   that is caused by the malady. An affected drive will, after accepting a
   disk, will start making a clicking noise and refuse to eject the disk. A
   common solution for retrieving the disk is to insert the bent end of a
   paper clip into a small hole adjacent to the slot. &#8220;<span class="quote">Clicked</span>&#8221;
   disks are generally unusable after being retrieved from the drive.</p><p>The clicking noise is caused by the drive's read/write head bumping
   against its movement stops when it fails to find track 0 on the disk,
   causing the head to become misaligned. This can happen when the drive has
   been subjected to a physical shock, or when the disk is exposed to an
   electromagnetic field, such as that of the CRT.  Another common cause
   is when a package of disks is armed with an anti-theft strip
   at a store. When the clerk scans the product to disarm the strip, it can
   demagnetize the disks, wiping out track 0.</p><p>There is evidence that the click of death is a communicable disease;
   a &#8220;<span class="quote">clicked</span>&#8221; disk can cause the read/write head of a &quot;clean&quot;
   drive to become misaligned. Iomega at first denied the existence of the
   click of death, but eventually offered to replace free of charge any drives
   affected by the condition.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="clean.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="CLM.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">clean </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> CLM</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
