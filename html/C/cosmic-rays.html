   The British seem to prefer the usage <span class="firstterm">cosmic
   showers</span>; <span class="firstterm">alpha particles</span>
   is also heard, because stray alpha particles passing through a memory chip
   can cause single-bit errors (this becomes increasingly more likely as
   memory sizes and densities increase).</p></dd><dd><p>Factual note: Alpha particles cause bit rot, cosmic rays do not
   (except occasionally in spaceborne computers).  Intel could not explain
   random bit drops in their early chips, and one hypothesis was cosmic rays.
   So they created the World's Largest Lead Safe, using 25 tons of the stuff,
   and used two identical boards for testing.  One was placed in the safe, one
   outside.  The hypothesis was that if cosmic rays were causing the bit
   drops, they should see a statistically significant difference between the
   error rates on the two boards.  They did not observe such a difference.
   Further investigation demonstrated conclusively that the bit drops were due
   to alpha particle emissions from thorium (and to a much lesser degree
   uranium) in the encapsulation material.  Since it is impossible to
   eliminate these radioactives (they are uniformly distributed through the
   earth's crust, with the statistically insignificant exception of uranium
   lodes) it became obvious that one has to design memories to withstand these
   hits.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Core-Wars.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="cough-and-die.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Core Wars </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> cough and die</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
