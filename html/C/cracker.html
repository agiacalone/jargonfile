Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in
   defense against journalistic misuse of <a href="../H/hacker.html"><i class="glossterm">hacker</i></a> (q.v.,
   sense 8).  An earlier attempt to establish <span class="firstterm">worm</span> in this sense around 1981--82 on Usenet
   was largely a failure.</p><p>Use of both these neologisms reflects a strong revulsion against the
   theft and vandalism perpetrated by cracking rings. The neologism
   &#8220;<span class="quote">cracker</span>&#8221; in this sense may have been influenced not so much
   by the term &#8220;<span class="quote">safe-cracker</span>&#8221; as by the non-jargon term
   &#8220;<span class="quote">cracker</span>&#8221;, which in Middle English meant an obnoxious person
   (e.g., &#8220;<span class="quote">What cracker is this same that deafs our ears / With this
   abundance of superfluous breath?</span>&#8221; &#8212; Shakespeare's King John, Act
   II, Scene I) and in modern colloquial American English survives as a barely
   gentler synonym for &#8220;<span class="quote">white trash</span>&#8221;.</p><p>While it is expected that any real hacker will have done some playful
   cracking and knows many of the basic techniques, anyone past
   <a href="../L/larval-stage.html"><i class="glossterm">larval stage</i></a> is expected to have outgrown the desire
   to do so except for immediate, benign, practical reasons (for example, if
   it's necessary to get around some security in order to get some work
   done).</p><p>Thus, there is far less overlap between hackerdom and crackerdom than
   the <a href="../M/mundane.html"><i class="glossterm">mundane</i></a> reader misled by sensationalistic
   journalism might expect.  Crackers tend to gather in small, tight-knit,
   very secretive groups that have little overlap with the huge, open
   poly-culture this lexicon describes; though crackers often like to describe
   <span class="emphasis"><em>themselves</em></span> as hackers, most true hackers consider them
   a separate and lower form of life.  An easy way for outsiders to spot
   the difference is that crackers use grandiose screen names that conceal
   their identities.  Hackers never do this; they only rarely use
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">noms de guerre</i></span> at all, and when they
   do it is for display rather than concealment.</p><p>Ethical considerations aside, hackers figure that anyone who can't
   imagine a more interesting way to play with their computers than breaking
   into someone else's has to be pretty <a href="../L/losing.html"><i class="glossterm">losing</i></a>.  Some
   other reasons crackers are looked down on are discussed in the entries on
   <a href="cracking.html"><i class="glossterm">cracking</i></a> and <a href="../P/phreaking.html"><i class="glossterm">phreaking</i></a>.  See
