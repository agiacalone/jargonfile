   sugar</i></a>; the term is also a play on &#8216;candygram&#8217;.
   <a href="COBOL.html"><i class="glossterm">COBOL</i></a>, Apple's Hypertalk language, and a lot of the
   so-called &#8216;4GL&#8217; database languages share this property.  The
   usual intent of such designs is that they be as English-like as possible,
   on the theory that they will then be easier for unskilled people to
   program.  This intention comes to grief on the reality that syntax isn't
   what makes programming hard; it's the mental effort and organization
   required to specify an algorithm precisely that costs.  Thus the invariable
   result is that &#8216;candygrammar&#8217; languages are just as difficult
   to program in as terser ones, and far more painful for the experienced
   hacker.</p><p>[The overtones from the old Chevy Chase skit on Saturday Night Live
   should not be overlooked.  This was a <i class="citetitle">Jaws</i> parody.
   Someone lurking outside an apartment door tries all kinds of bogus ways to
   get the occupant to open up, while ominous music plays in the background.
   The last attempt is a half-hearted &#8220;<span class="quote">Candygram!</span>&#8221; When the door
   is opened, a shark bursts in and chomps the poor occupant.  [There is a
   similar gag in &#8220;<span class="quote">Blazing Saddles</span>&#8221; &#8212;ESR] There is a moral
   here for those attracted to candygrammars.  Note that, in many circles,
   pretty much the same ones who remember Monty Python sketches, all it takes
   is the word &#8220;<span class="quote">Candygram!</span>&#8221;, suitably timed, to get people
   rolling on the floor. &#8212; GLS]</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Cancelmoose.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="canonical.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Cancelmoose[tm] </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> canonical</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
