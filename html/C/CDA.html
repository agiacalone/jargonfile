   of a major telecommunications reform bill on February 8th, 1996
   (&#8220;<span class="quote">Black Thursday</span>&#8221;). The CDA made it a federal crime in the USA
   to send a communication which is &#8220;<span class="quote">obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy,
   or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another
   person.</span>&#8221; It also threatened with imprisonment anyone who
   &#8220;<span class="quote">knowingly</span>&#8221; makes accessible to minors any message that
   &#8220;<span class="quote">describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
   community standards, sexual or excretory activities or
   organs</span>&#8221;.</p><p>While the CDA was sold as a measure to protect minors from the
   putative evils of pornography, the repressive political aims of the bill
   were laid bare by the Hyde amendment, which intended to outlaw discussion
   of abortion on the Internet.</p><p>To say that this direct attack on First Amendment free-speech rights
   was not well received on the Internet would be putting it mildly.  A
   firestorm of protest followed, including a February 29th 1996 mass
   demonstration by thousands of netters who turned their <a href="../H/home-page.html"><i class="glossterm">home
   page</i></a>s black for 48 hours.  Several civil-rights groups and
   computing/telecommunications companies mounted a constitutional challenge.
   The CDA was demolished by a strongly-worded decision handed down in
   8th-circuit Federal court and subsequently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme
   Court on 26 June 1997 (&#8220;<span class="quote">White Thursday</span>&#8221;). See also
