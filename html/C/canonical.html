   law&#8217;] The usual or standard state or manner of something.  This word
   has a somewhat more technical meaning in mathematics.  Two formulas such as
   <tt class="literal">9 + x</tt> and <tt class="literal">x +
   9</tt> are said to be equivalent because they mean the same
   thing, but the second one is in <span class="firstterm">canonical
   form</span> because it is written in the usual way, with the highest
   power of <tt class="literal">x</tt> first.  Usually there are fixed
   rules you can use to decide whether something is in canonical form.  The
   jargon meaning, a relaxation of the technical meaning, acquired its present
   loading in computer-science culture largely through its prominence in
   Alonzo Church's work in computation theory and mathematical logic (see
   <a href="../K/Knights-of-the-Lambda-Calculus.html"><i class="glossterm">Knights of the Lambda Calculus</i></a>).  Compare
   <a href="../V/vanilla.html"><i class="glossterm">vanilla</i></a>.</p><p>Non-technical academics do not use the adjective
   &#8216;canonical&#8217; in any of the senses defined above with any
   regularity; they do however use the nouns <span class="firstterm">canon</span> and <span class="firstterm">canonicity</span> (not **canonicalness or
   **canonicality). The <span class="firstterm">canon</span> of a given
   author is the complete body of authentic works by that author (this usage
   is familiar to Sherlock Holmes fans as well as to literary scholars).
   &#8216;<span class="emphasis"><em>The</em></span> canon&#8217; is the body of works in a
   given field (e.g., works of literature, or of art, or of music) deemed
   worthwhile for students to study and for scholars to investigate.</p><p>The word &#8216;canon&#8217; has an interesting history.  It derives
   ultimately from the Greek
   <span class="foreignphrase"><i class="foreignphrase">&#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;</i></span> (akin to the
   English &#8216;cane&#8217;) referring to a reed.  Reeds were used for
   measurement, and in Latin and later Greek the word &#8216;canon&#8217;
   meant a rule or a standard.  The establishment of a canon of scriptures
   within Christianity was meant to define a standard or a rule for the
   religion.  The above non-techspeak academic usages stem from this instance
   of a defined and accepted body of work.  Alongside this usage was the
   promulgation of &#8216;canons&#8217; (&#8216;rules&#8217;) for the
   government of the Catholic Church.  The techspeak usages (&#8220;<span class="quote">according
   to religious law</span>&#8221;) derive from this use of the Latin
   &#8216;canon&#8217;.</p><p>Hackers invest this term with a playfulness that makes an ironic
   contrast with its historical meaning.  A true story: One Bob Sjoberg, new
   at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some annoyance at the incessant use of jargon.
   Over his loud objections, GLS and RMS made a point of using as much of it
   as possible in his presence, and eventually it began to sink in.  Finally,
   in one conversation, he used the word <span class="firstterm">canonical</span> in jargon-like fashion without
   thinking.  Steele: &#8220;<span class="quote">Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon
   too!</span>&#8221; Stallman: &#8220;<span class="quote">What did he say?</span>&#8221; Steele: &#8220;<span class="quote">Bob
   just used &#8216;canonical&#8217; in the canonical way.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Of course, canonicality depends on context, but it is implicitly
   defined as the way <span class="emphasis"><em>hackers</em></span> normally expect things to
   be.  Thus, a hacker may claim with a straight face that &#8216;according to
   religious law&#8217; is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the canonical meaning of
   <span class="firstterm">canonical</span>.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="candygrammar.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="careware.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">candygrammar </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> careware</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
