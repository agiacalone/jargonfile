   <b class="command">COME FROM</b> &lt;label&gt; would cause the
   referenced label to act as a sort of trapdoor, so that if the program ever
   reached it control would quietly and <a href="../A/automagically.html"><i class="glossterm">automagically</i></a>
   be transferred to the statement following the <b class="command">COME
   FROM</b>.  <b class="command">COME FROM</b> was first
   proposed in R. Lawrence Clark's <i class="citetitle">A Linguistic Contribution to
   GOTO-less programming</i>, which appeared in a 1973
   <a href="../D/Datamation.html"><i class="glossterm">Datamation</i></a> issue (and was reprinted in the April
   1984 issue of <i class="citetitle">Communications of the ACM</i>).  This
   parodied the then-raging &#8216;structured programming&#8217;
   <a href="../H/holy-wars.html"><i class="glossterm">holy wars</i></a> (see <a href="considered-harmful.html"><i class="glossterm">considered
   harmful</i></a>).  Mythically, some variants are the <span class="firstterm">assigned COME FROM</span> and the <span class="firstterm">computed COME FROM</span> (parodying some nasty
   control constructs in FORTRAN and some extended BASICs).  Of course,
   multi-tasking (or non-determinism) could be implemented by having more than
   one <b class="command">COME FROM</b> statement coming from the
   same label.</p><p>In some ways the FORTRAN <b class="command">DO</b> looks
   like a <b class="command">COME FROM</b> statement.  After the
   terminating statement number/<b class="command">CONTINUE</b> is
   reached, control continues at the statement following the DO.  Some
   generous FORTRANs would allow arbitrary statements (other than <b class="command">CONTINUE</b>) for the statement, leading to examples
   like:</p><table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><tr><td><pre class="programlisting">
      DO 10 I=1,LIMIT
C imagine many lines of code here, leaving the
C original DO statement lost in the spaghetti...
      WRITE(6,10) I,FROB(I)
 10   FORMAT(1X,I5,G10.4)
</pre></td></tr></table><p>in which the trapdoor is just after the statement labeled 10.  (This
   is particularly surprising because the label doesn't appear to have
   anything to do with the flow of control at all!)  While sufficiently
   astonishing to the unsuspecting reader, this form of <b class="command">COME FROM</b> statement isn't completely general.  After
   all, control will eventually pass to the following statement.  The
   implementation of the general form was left to Univac FORTRAN, ca. 1975
   (though a roughly similar feature existed on the IBM 7040 ten years
   earlier).  The statement <b class="command">AT 100</b> would
   perform a <b class="command">COME FROM 100</b>.  It was intended
   strictly as a debugging aid, with dire consequences promised to anyone so
   deranged as to use it in production code.  More horrible things had already
   been perpetrated in production languages, however; doubters need only
   contemplate the <b class="command">ALTER</b> verb in
   <a href="COBOL.html"><i class="glossterm">COBOL</i></a>.  <b class="command">COME FROM</b>
   was supported under its own name for the first time 15 years later, in
   C-INTERCAL (see <a href="../I/INTERCAL.html"><i class="glossterm">INTERCAL</i></a>,
   <a href="../R/retrocomputing.html"><i class="glossterm">retrocomputing</i></a>); knowledgeable observers are still
   reeling from the shock.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="cold-boot.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../C.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="comm-mode.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">cold boot </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> comm mode</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
