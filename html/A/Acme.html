   perfection or achievement] The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate,
   and non-functional gadgetry &#8212; where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson
   (two cartoonists who specialized in elaborate contraptions) shop.  The name
   has been humorously expanded as A (or American) Company Making Everything.
   (In fact, Acme was a real brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the
   early 1900s.)  Describing some X as an &#8220;<span class="quote">Acme X</span>&#8221; either means
   &#8220;<span class="quote">This is <a href="../I/insanely-great.html"><i class="glossterm">insanely great</i></a></span>&#8221;, or, more
   likely, &#8220;<span class="quote">This looks <a href="../I/insanely-great.html"><i class="glossterm">insanely great</i></a> on paper,

   it.</span>&#8221; Compare <a href="../P/pistol.html"><i class="glossterm">pistol</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained here
   for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the Warner Brothers'
   series of &#8220;<span class="quote">Road-runner</span>&#8221; cartoons.  In these cartoons, the
   famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap, and
   eat the Road-runner.  His attempts usually involved one or more
   high-technology Rube Goldberg devices &#8212; rocket jetpacks, catapults,
   magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered
   in large wooden crates labeled prominently with the Acme name &#8212;
   which, probably not by coincidence, was the trade name of a peg bar system
   for superimposing animation cels used by cartoonists since forever. Acme
   devices invariably malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ACK.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../A.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ad-hockery.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">ACK </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> ad-hockery</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
