   based on 680x0 processors, custom support chips and an operating system
   that combined some of the best features of Macintosh and Unix with
   compatibility with neither.</p><p>The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world
   standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious
   market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial
   technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a small
   but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one day
   unseating the clones (see <a href="Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html"><i class="glossterm">Amiga Persecution Complex</i></a>).
   The traits of this culture are both spoofed and
   illuminated in <a href="http://www.blazemonger.com/BM/" target="_top"> The BLAZE Humor
   Viewer</a>. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small industry
   of companies building software and hardware for the platform, especially in
   graphics and video applications (see <a href="../V/video-toaster.html"><i class="glossterm">video toaster</i></a>).
   </p><p>Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&amp;D,
   allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead.  After
   Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several
   hands, none of whom did much with it.  However, the Amiga is still being
   produced in Europe under license and has a substantial number of fans,
   which will probably extend the platform's life considerably.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ambimouseterous.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="../A.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="Amiga-Persecution-Complex.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">ambimouseterous </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="../index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Amiga Persecution Complex</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
