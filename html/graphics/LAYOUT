Here's how to lay out the illustrations.  They divide into four classes:

	1. Crunchly cartoons from the original `Crunchland' tableau.
	2. The Crunchly strips proper.
	3. The new Crunchly cartoon by Guy.
	4. The `blivet' illo.
	5. The `eat flaming death' panels.

Almost all the Crunchly cartoons are grouped into 4-panel strips (the
exceptions are the big tableau spread that started the series, #1
above, the 3/17/76 strip consisting of 8 panels, and the 5/1 strip as
noted below).  The early ones (before 10/4/75) are physically grouped into
4 panels per original page.  The 10/4/75 strip is spread across two
pages.  All the later ones are inked in a larger size, one panel per
original page, except for the 5/1 strip which is a three-panel strip
spread across two original pages.

In almost all cases, we want to use the cartoons in their four-panel
groups, reduced to a uniform size and occupying a page each.  The
exceptions are (again) the vignettes from the tableau spread, and the
8-panel 3-17-76 strip, which gets broken up into three groups:

Panel 1:    Runs on the section-heading page for the lexicon.
Panel 2:    Runs as a single panel in-line with the `batch' entry.
Panels 5-8: Runs as a four-panel group with `flushed'.

The three-panel strip from 5/1 could either have its own page or be
run in-line, 3 panels across the page.

This uses all the Crunchly strips except the `surfers integral' one (5/24/73)
and panels 3,4 of 3/17/76.

The vignettes from the tableau should be reduced to single-panel size
and run in-line with their entries: likewise for Guy's all-new `C'
cartoon (#3).  There will be three of these:

Ada:        The PL/1-FORTRAN dialogue (caption: `Nowadays we say this of Ada.')
C:          The SNOBOL-C dialogue
                (caption `The Crunchly on the left looks a little ANSI')
LISP:       The APL-LISP dialogue (caption `We've got your numbers...')
Real World: The RPG-COBOL vignette (caption: `Life in the Real World.')

Note that the SNOBOL crunchly is paired with a new cartoon by Guy; a
crunchly labeled `C', saying `Number crunching used to be double
trouble for me, but I'm more single-minded now.'

All the full-page illos will be captioned.  If the full-page illos are
set flush with the top of text, then on a 26 x 49 pica layout that
should leave about five lines of text at the bottom.  Captions are
already set in the text.

In the illustration references below, a `full page' illo will have its
own page facing text; `in line' illos will be run following their
entries.  Each date labels a Crunchly strip (#2); numbers following a
colon are panel numbers.  The `vignettes' are the four pieces of the
Crunchland tableau described above.  The odd ones out are the `blivet'
and `eat flaming death' illos.
